My office is **PRD 9.320** which is the maths area on the 9th floor of the **Physics Research Deck** (PRD). My office is quite difficult to find, so here are some directions:

* You need to start on the **"red route"** around the 10th floor of the main campus building. You can get onto the red route various ways, such as via the Boyle library (it's one floor above the Edit cafe), or via the School of Mathematics (it's one floor above the entrance).
* Follow the red route along the **EC Stoner building**. You will follow a long corridor past IT services and past the "Maths Satellite", all the way along to **staircase 4** (The maths area of the PRD is signposted from the Maths Satellite, but not very obviously).
* From staircase 4 on the 10th floor red route in the EC Stoner building, go down two floors to the **8th floor**.
* The **Physics Research Deck** is off to your left. Go along the corridor, though two sets of double doors.
* The **maths area of the PRD** will be signposted to your right, though a door, and up a flight of stairs.
* Once up on the 9th floor maths area of the PRD, my office (**PRD 9.320**) is back on yourself, towards the Observatory.

My experience is that, on first attempt, it often takes students about 10 minutes longer to find my office than they think it will.

Here's a badly-drawn map:
