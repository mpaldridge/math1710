When we looked a discrete distributions, we saw the `dxxx()`, `pxxx()`, `qxxx()` and `rxxx()` functions (where `xxx` could be `binom`, `geom` or `pois`). These gave, respectively the PMF, CDF, quantile function, and random samples. The same works with continuous distributions `norm` (for the normal distribution), `exp` (for the exponential distribution), or `beta` (for the Beta distribution, which we shall see later in Lecture 20).

We will concentrate in this worksheet just on the functions for the normal distribution:

* **`dnorm()`** gives the probability density function $f(x)$ of a normal distribution $X \sim \mathrm{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)$. The format is `dnorm(x, mu, sigma)`, where `x` is the point at which the density is evaluated, `mu` is the expectation $\mu$ of the normal distribution, and `sigma` is the standard deviation $\sigma$ of the normal distribution. Note that the third parameter is the standard deviation $\sigma$ -- that is, the square-root $\sigma = \sqrt{\sigma^2}$ of the variance -- not the variance $\sigma^2$ itself: this is the easiest mistake to make when working with the normal distribution in R!

* **`pnorm()`** gives the CDF $F(x) = \mathbb P(X \leq x)$ of a normal distribution. The format is `pnorm(x, mu, sigma)` in the same way.
   * There is an optional argument `lower.tail`. By default this is set to `TRUE`, which gives the CDF $F(x) = \mathbb P(X \leq x)$; but when set to `FALSE`, we instead get the upper-tail probability $1 - F(x) = \mathbb P(X > x)$. So a full command for that is `pnorm(x, mu, sigma, lower.tail = FALSE)`.
   
* **`qnorm()`** gives the quantile function $F^{-1}(q)$. That is, `qnorm(q, mu, sigma)` gives the value $x$ such that $F(x) = \mathbb P(X \leq x ) = q$. 
   * Similarly, there is a `lower.tail = FALSE` argument that gives the $x$ such that $1 - F(x) = \mathbb P(X > x) = q$.
   
* **`rnorm()`** generates random IID samples from a normal distribution. That is, `rnorm(n, mu, sigma)` gives $n$ such random samples.

In all these functions, if `mu` and `sigma` are omitted, it is assumed you are dealing with a standard normal distribution $\mu = 0, \sigma^2 = \sigma = 1$.

The `pnorm()` function is the most important of these functions and is the one we use most often. Unlike with discrete random variables, it's rarely useful to use the PDF `dnorm()`; instead, we use the CDF `pnorm()`. In particular, the probabiltiy $\mathbb P(a \leq X \leq b)$ that $X$ lies in some interval $[a,b]$ is given by `pnorm(b, mu, sigma) - pnorm(a, mu, sigma)`.

In [Lecture 16](https://mpaldridge.github.io/math1710/L16-normal.html#normal-r) we gave many examples of how to perform calculations using the `pnorm()` and one example `qnorm()` functions. Your main task for this worksheet is to revise what was in that lecture.

> **Exercise 9.1.** What is the value of the standard normal density at 0?

> **Exercise 9.2.** Let $X_2 \sim \mathrm{N}(10, 25)$. What is $\mathbb P(X > 16 \text{ or } X \leq 8)$?

> **Exercise 9.3.** Let $X_3 \sim \mathrm{N} (100, 10^2)$. Give an interval, symmetric around the expectation, such that $X_3$ has a 50:50 chance of landing in that interval.

> **Exercise 9.4.** Let $X_4 \sim \mathrm{N}(42, 17^2)$. Sample 10,000 samples from the distribution $X_4$. Calculate the sample mean and sample variance of your samples.

We briefly mention that the `pexp()` variation takes the format `pexp(x, lambda)`, where $x$ is where the CDF should be evaluated and `lambda` is the rate parameter $\lambda$.

> **Exercise 9.5.** Let $X_4 \sim \mathrm{Exp}(0.2)$. Calculate $\mathbb P(4 \leq X_4 \leq 7)$ using the `pexp()` function.

The `pbeta()` variation takes the format `pbeta(x, alpha, beta)`, which will make sense to you after Lecture 20.

## Assessed questions

*The following five assessed questions should be submitted [via this Microsoft Form](). I recommend you do this in Week 9, but the official deadline is **Monday 5 December at 1400**.*

*This work will be marked automatically by computer, so make sure your answers are accurate -- the computer does not "know what you meant"; only what you actually enter into the form.*

*So that (most) students get a different distribution to work with, you will work from a file whose name is based on your student ID number. Your student ID number is (usually) a 9-digit number starting `201`. Your dataset is the CSV file at*

```
https://mpaldridge.github.io/math1710/data/R8-xy.csv
```

*where `xy` is replaced by the last two digits of your student ID number. So if your student ID is `201623429`, then you should use the file at `https://mpaldridge.github.io/math1710/data/R8-29.csv`; if your student ID number is `201491200` then you should use the file `https://mpaldridge.github.io/math1710/data/R8-00.csv` and so on. Take care to check you get this correct: if you get your student ID number wrong and/or use the wrong data file, the computer is likely to award you 0 marks.*

The first two questions are based on a discrete random variable $X$. Read the CSV file at `https://mpaldridge.github.io/math1710/data/R8-xy.csv` into R. Remember that `xy` should be replaced by the last 2 digits of your student ID number. This data set has two columns, called `x` and `pmf_x`. The column `x` represents the range of the discrete random variable $X$, and the column `pmf_x` represents the values of the PMF $p_X(x) = \mathbb P(X = x)$ of $X$.

> **Assessed Question 1.** What is $\mathbb P(X \leq 234.5)$? Round your answer to three significant figures.*

> **Assessed Question 2.** Calculate the variance of $X$. Round your answer to two decimal places.

The final three questions are based on the continuous normal distribution $Y \sim \mathrm{N}(100, i+1)$, where $i$ is the final *single* digit of your student ID. that is, the normal distribution with expectation $\mu = 100$, and whose *variance* $\sigma^2$ is equal to the last digit of your student ID plus 1.

> **Assessed Question 3.** What is the probability $\mathbb P(Y \geq 103)$? Round your answer to three significant figures.

> **Assessed Question 4.** What is the conditional probability $\mathbb P(Y < 97 \mid Y < 99)$? Round your answer to three significant figures.

> **Assessed Question 5.** What is the value of the PDF $f_Y(y)$ evaluated at the 95th percentile $y$ of $Y$; that is, evaluated at $y$, where $y$ is the point below which 95% of the probability lies? Round your answer to three significant figures.

*Remember to submit your answers [via the Microsoft Form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=qO3qvR3IzkWGPlIypTW3ywARQdZlKXRHsLcXi_ngX8NUQzFRVERNNVpXWTdQT0gzOTdHNE9RWlIwRy4u).*
