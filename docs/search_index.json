A few students will be taking this module as half of MATH2700 Probability and Statistics for Scientists. This module lasts for 11 weeks from 27 September to 10 December 2021. The exam will take place between 10 and 21 January 2022. The core teaching team are: Dr Matthew Aldridge (you can call me “Matt” or “Dr Aldridge”): I am the module leader, the main lecturer, and the main author of these notes. A module assistant TBC. The shared email address for the core teaching team is math1710@leeds.ac.uk; please use this address, rather than emailing our personal addresses; this will ensure your email is seen as soon as possible. Notes and videos The main way you will learn new material for this module is by reading these notes and by watching the accompanying pre-recorded videos. There will be one section of notes each week, for a total of 11 sections, with the final section being a summary and revision. Reading mathematics is a slow process. Each section should take one and a half to two hours to work through; we recommend you split this into two or more sessions. If you find yourself regularly getting through sections in much less than that amount of time, you’re probably not reading carefully enough through each sentence of explanation and each line of mathematics, including understanding the motivation, checking the accuracy, and making your own notes. You are probably reading the web version of the notes. If you want a PDF or ebook copy (to read offline or to print out), they can be downloaded via the top ribbon of the page. (Warning: I have not made as much effort to make the PDF and ebook as neat and tidy as I have the web version, and there may be formatting errors.) We are very keen to hear about errors in the notes mathematical, typographical or otherwise. Please, please email us if think you may have found any. Problem sheets There will be 5 problem sheets. Each problem sheet has a number of short and long questions for you to cover in your own time to help you learn the material, and two assessed questions, which you should submit for marking. The assessed questions on each problem sheet make up 3% of your mark on this module, for a total of 15%. Although the deadlines are on Mondays, you are advised to complete and submit the work in the previous week. Problem Sheet Sections covered Assessed work due 1 1 Monday 11 October (Week 3) 2 2 and 3 Monday 25 October (Week 5) 3 4 and 5 Monday 8 November (Week 7) 4 6 and 7 Monday 22 November (Week 9) 5 8, 9 and 10 Monday 6 December (Week 11) Assessed questions should be submitted in PDF format through Gradescope. (Further Gradescope details will follow.) Most students choose to hand-write their solutions and then scan them to PDF using their phone; you should use a proper scanning app – we recommend Microsoft Office Lens or Adobe Scan – and not just submit photographs. Lectures You will have one online synchronous (that is, live, not recorded) “lecture” session each week, with me, run through Zoom. Because this is a large cohort, we will split into two groups: Group 1: Mondays at 1200 Group 2: Mondays at 1500 You should check your timetable to see which lecture group you are in. This will not be a “lecture” in the traditional sense of the term, but will be an opportunity to re-emphasise material you have already learned from notes and videos, to give extra examples, and to answer common student questions, with some degree of interactivity via quizzes, polls, and the chat box. We will assume you have completed all the work for the previous week by the time of the lecture. We are very keen to hear about things you’d like to go through in the lectures; please email us with your suggestions. Tutorials Tutorials are small groups of about a dozen students. You have been assigned to one of 38 tutorial groups, each with a member of staff as the tutor. Your tutorial group will meet five times, in Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10. Tutorial groups will meet in person on campus; you should check your timetable to see when and where your tutorial group meets. (For those not yet on campus, due to travel restrictions or health conditions, there will be an extra online tutorial group for the first few tutorials.) The main goal of the tutorials will be to go over your answers to the non-assessed questions on the problems sheets in an interactive session. In this smaller group, you will be able to ask detailed questions of your tutor, and have the chance to discuss your answers to the problem sheet. Your tutor may ask you to present some of your work to your fellow students, or may give you the opportunity to work together with others during the tutorial. Your tutor may be willing to give you a hint on the assessed questions if you’ve made a first attempt but have got stuck. My recommended approach to problem sheets and tutorials is the following: Work through the problem sheet before the tutorial, spending plenty of time on it, and making multiple efforts at questions you get stuck on. I recommend spending at least 3 hours per week on the problem sheets, which will usually mean a total of at least 6 hours per problem sheet (as most problem sheets cover two weeks). Collaboration is encouraged when working through the non-assessed problems, but I recommend writing up your work on your own; answers to assessed questions must be solely your own work. Take advantage of the small group setting of the tutorial to ask for help or clarification on questions you weren’t able to complete. After the tutorial, attempt again the questions you were previously stuck on. If you’re still unable to complete a question after this second round of attempts, then consult the solutions. Your tutor will also be the marker of your answers to the assessed questions on the problem sheets. R worksheets R is a programming language that is particularly good at working with probability and statistics. Learning to use R is an important part of this module, and is used in many other modules in the University, particularly in MATH1712 Probability and Statistics II. R is used by statisticians throughout academic and increasingly in industry too. Learning to program is a valuable skill for all students, and learning to use R is particularly valuable for students interested in statistics and related topics like actuarial science. You will learn R by working through one R worksheet each week in your own time. Worksheets 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11 will also contain a couple of questions for assessment. Each of these is worth 3% of your mark for a total of 15%. I recommend spending one hour per week on the week’s R worksheet, plus one extra hour if there are assessed questions that week. You can read more about the language R, and about the program RStudio that we recommend you use to interact with R, in the R section of these notes. To help you if you have problems with R, we have organised optional R troubleshooting drop-in sessions, where you can discuss any problems you have with an R expert, in Weeks 2 and 3. Check your timetable for details – these will be listed on your timetable as “practicals”. Optional “office hours” drop-in sessions If you there is something in the module you wish to discuss privately one-on-one with the module core teaching team, the place for the is the optional weekly “office hours”, which will operate as drop-in sessions. These sessions are an optional opportunity for you to ask questions you have to a member of staff; these are particularly useful if there’s something on the module that you are stuck on or confused about, but we’re happy to discuss any statistics-related issues or questions you have. There will be two “office hours” drop-in sessions per week: Wednesday at 1000 in Charles Thackrah SR G.07 Wednesday at 1200 in Emmanuel Centre SR 02 (For timetabling reasons, the 1000 sessions appear on the timetable for MATH2700 students and the 1200 sessions appear on the timetable for MATH1710 students, but I’m happy for anyone to attend either hour.) Time management It is, of course, up to you how you choose to spend your time on this module. But my recommendations for your weekly work would be something like this: Notes and videos: 2 hours per week/section Problem sheet: 3 hours per week (so 6 hours for most problem sheets) plus 1 extra hour for writing up and submitting answers to assessed questions R worksheet: 1 hour per week/worksheet, plus 1 extra hour if there are assessed questions Lecture: 1 hour per week Tutorial: 1 hour every other week Revision: 13 hours total at the end of the module That’s roughly 8 hours a week, and makes 100 hours in total. (MATH1710 is a 10 credit module, so is supposed to represent 100 hours work. MATH2700 students are expected to be able to use their greater experience to get through the material in just 75 hours, so should scale these recommendations accordingly.) Exam There will be an exam in January, which makes up the remaining 70% of your mark. The exam will consist of 20 short and 2 long questions, and will be time-limited to 2 hours. We’ll talk more about the exam format near the end of the module. Who should I ask about…? Remember that the email address for the core module teaching team is math1710@leeds.ac.uk. Please don’t email our personal addresses; it will take longer for us to reply, and we may miss your email all together. I don’t understand something in the notes or on a problem sheet: Come to office hours, or (if the timing works) ask your tutor in your next tutorial. I’m having difficulties with R: In Weeks 2 or 3, you should attend the R trouble-shooting drop-in session; at other times, come to office hours. I have an admin question about arrangements for the module: Come to office hours or email the core module teaching team. I have an admin question about arrangements for my tutorial: Contact your tutor. I have an admin question about general arrangements for my course as a whole: Email the Maths Taught Students Office (Maths.Taught.Students@leeds.ac.uk) or speak to your personal academic tutor. I have a question about the marking of my assessed work on the problem sheets: First, check your feedback on Gradescope; if you still have questions, contact your tutor. I have a question about the marking of my assessed work on the R worksheets: Come to office hours or email the core module teaching team. I have suggestion for something to cover in the lectures: Email the core module teaching team. Due to exceptional personal circumstances I require an extension on or exemption from assessed work: Email the Maths Taught Students Office; neither the core module teaching team nor your tutor are able to offer extensions or exemptions. (Only exemptions, not extensions, are available for R worksheets.) Content of MATH1710 Prerequisites The formal prerequisite for MATH1710 is “Grade B in A-level Mathematics or equivalent”. We’ll assume you have some basic school-level maths knowledge, but we don’t assume you’ve studied probability or statistics in detail before (although we recognise that many of you will have). If you have studied probability and/or statistics at A-level (or post-16 equivalent) level, you’ll recognise some of the material in this module; however you should find that we go deeper in some areas, and that we treat the material through with a greater deal of mathematical formality and rigour. “Rigour” here means precisely stating our assumptions, and carefully proving how other statements follow from those assumptions. Syllabus The module has three parts: a short first part on “exploratory data analysis”, a long middle part on probability theory, and a short final part on a statistical framework called “Bayesian statistics”. There’s also the weekly R worksheets, which you could count as a fourth part running in parallel, but which will connect with the other parts too. An outline plan of the topics covered is the following. (Remember that one section is one week’s work.) Exploratory data analysis [1 section] Summary statistics, data visualisation Probability [8 sections] Probability with events: Probability spaces, probability axioms, examples and properties of probability, “classical probability” of equally likely events, independence, conditional probability, Bayes’ theorem [3 sections] Probability with random variables: Discrete random variables, expectation and variance, binomial distribution, geometric distribution, Poisson distribution, multiple random variables, law of large numbers, continuous random variables, exponential distribution, normal distribution, central limit theorem [5 sections] Bayesian statistics [1 section]: Bayesian framework, Beta prior, normal–normal model Summary and revision [1 section] Books You can do well on this module by reading the notes and watching the videos, attending the lectures and tutorials, and working on the problem sheets and R worksheets, without needing to do any further reading beyond this. However, students can benefit from optional extra background reading or an alternative view on the material, especially in the parts of the module on probability. For exploratory data analysis, you can stick to Wikipedia, but if you really want a book, I’d recommend: GM Clarke and D Cooke, A Basic Course in Statistics, 5th edition, Edward Arnold, 2004. For the probability section, any book with a title like “Introduction to Probability” would do. Some of my favourites are: JK Blitzstein and J Hwang, Introduction to Probability, 2nd edition, CRC Press, 2019. G Grimmett and D Welsh, Probability: An Introduction, 2nd edition, Oxford University Press, 2014. (The library has online access.) SM Ross, A First Course in Probability, 10th edition, Pearson, 2020. RL Scheaffer and LJ Young, Introduction to Probability and Its Applications, 3rd edition, Cengage, 2010. D Stirzaker, Elementary Probability, 2nd edition, Cambridge University Press, 2003. (The library has online access.) On Bayesian statistics, I recommend: JV Stone, Bayes’ Rule: A Tutorial Introduction to Bayesian Analysis, Sebtel Press, 2013. For R, there are many excellent resources online, and Google is your friend for finding them. (For all these books I’ve listed the newest editions, but older editions are usually fine too.) About these notes These notes were written by Matthew Aldridge in 2021. They are based in part on previous notes by Dr Robert G Aykroyd and Prof Wally Gilks. Dr Jason Anquandah and Dr Aykroyd advised on the R worksheets. Dr Aykroyd’s help and advice on many aspects of the module was particularly valuable. These notes (in the web format) should be accessible by screenreaders. The videos have (highly imperfect) automated subtitles. If you have accessibility difficulties with these notes, contact maths1710@leeds.ac.uk. "],["S01-eda.html", "Section 1 Exploratory data analysis 1.1 What is EDA? 1.2 What is R? 1.3 Summary statistics and boxplots 1.4 Binned data and histograms 1.5 Multiple variables and scatterplots Summary", " Section 1 Exploratory data analysis 1.1 What is EDA? Statistics is the study of data. Exploratory data analysis (or EDA, for short) is the part of statistics concerned with taking a “first look” at some data. Later, toward the end of this course, we will see more detailed and complex ways of building models for data, and in MATH1712 Probability and Statistics II (for those who take it) you will see many other statistical techniques – in particular, ways of testing formal hypotheses for data. But here we’re just interested in first impressions and brief summaries. In this section, we will concentrate on two aspects of EDA: Summary statistics: That is, calculating numbers that briefly summarise the data. A summary statistic might tell us what “central” or “typical” values of the data are, how spread out the data is, or about the relationship between two different variables. Data visualisation: Drawing a picture based on the data is an another way to show the shape (centrality and spread) of data, or the relationship between different variables. Even before calculating summary statistics or drawing a plot, however, there are other questions it is important to ask about the data: What is the data? What variables have been measured? How were they measured? How many datapoints are there? What is the possible range of responses? How was the data collected? Was data collected on the whole population or just a smaller sample? (If a sample: How was that sample chosen? Is that sample representative of the population?) How were there variable measured? Are there any outliers? “Outliers” are datapoints that seem to be very different from the other datapoints – for example, are much larger or much smaller than the others. Each outlier should be investigated to seek the reason for it. Perhaps it is a genuine-but-unusual datapoint (which is useful for understanding the extremes of the data), or perhaps there is an extraordinary explanation (a measurement or recording error, for example) meaning the data is not relevant. Once the reason for an outlier is understood, it then might be appropriate to exclude it from analysis (for example, the incorrectly recorded measurement). It’s usually bad practice to exclude an outlier merely for being an outlier before understanding what caused it. Ethical questions: Was the data collected ethically and, where necessary, with the informed consent of the subjects? Has it been stored properly? Are their privacy issues with the collection and storage of the data? What ethical issues should be considered before publishing (or not publishing) results of the analysis? Should the data be kept confidential, or should it be openly shared with other researchers for the betterment of science? 1.2 What is R? R is a programming language that is particularly good at working with probability and statistics. A convenient way to use the language R is through the program RStudio. An important part of this module is learning to use R, by completing weekly worksheets – you can read more in the R section of these notes. R can easily and quickly perform all the calculations and draw all the plots in this section of notes on exploratory data analysis. In this text, we’ll show the relevant R code. Code will appear like this: data &lt;- c(4, 7, 6, 7, 4, 5, 5) mean(data) ## [1] 5.428571 Here, the code in the first shaded box is the R commands that are typed into RStudio, which you can type in next to the &gt; arrow in the RStudio “console”. The numerical answers that R returns are shown here in the second unshaded box next to a double hashsign ##. The [1] can be ignored (this is just R’s way of saying that this is the first part of the answer – but all the answers here only have one part anyway). Plots produced by R are displayed here as pictures. Most importantly for now, you are not expected to understand the R code in this section yet. The code is included so that, in the future, as you work through the R worksheets week by week, you can look back at the code in the section, and it will start to make sense. By the time you have finished R Worksheet 5 in week 5, you should be able understand most of the R code in this section. 1.3 Summary statistics and boxplots Suppose we have collected some data on a certain variable. We will assume here that we have \\(n\\) datapoints, each of which is a single real number. We can write this data as a vector \\[ \\mathbf x = (x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n) . \\] A statistic is a calculation from the data \\(\\mathbf x\\), which is (usually) also a real number. In this section we will look at two types of “summary statistics”, which are statistics that we feel will give us useful information about the data. We’ll look here at two types of summary statistic: Measures of centrality, which tell us where the “middle” of the data is. Measures of spread, which tell us how far the data typically spreads out from that middle. Some measures of centrality are the following. Definition 1.1 Consider some real-valued data \\(\\mathbf x = (x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n)\\). The mode is the most common value of \\(x_i\\). (If there are multiple joint-most common values, they are all modes.) Suppose the data is ordered as \\(x_1 \\leq x_2 \\leq \\cdots \\leq x_n\\). Then the median is the central value in the ordered list. If \\(n\\) is odd, this is \\(x_{(n+1)/2}\\); if \\(n\\) is even, we normally take halfway between the two central points, \\(\\frac12(x_{n/2}+x_{n/2 + 1})\\). The mean \\(\\bar x\\) is \\[ \\bar x = \\frac{1}{n}(x_1 + x_2 + \\cdots + x_n) = \\frac1n \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i . \\] (In that last expression, we’ve made use of Sigma notation to write down the sum.) Example 1.1 Some packets of Skittles (a small fruit-flavoured sweet) were opened, and the number of Skittles in each packet counted. There were 13 packets, and the number of sweets (sorted from smallest to largest) were: \\[ 59, \\ 59, \\ 59, \\ 59, \\ 60, \\ 60, \\ 60, \\ 61, \\ 62, \\ 62, \\ 62, \\ 63, \\ 63 .\\] The mode is 59, because there were 4 packets containing 59 sweets; more than any other number. Since there are \\(n = 13\\) packets, the middle packet is number \\(i = 7\\), so the median is \\(x_7 = 60\\). The mean is \\[ \\bar x = \\frac{1}{13} (59 + 59 + \\cdots + 63) = \\frac{789}{13} = 60.7 .\\] The median is one example of a “quantile” of the data. Suppose our data is increasing order again. For \\(0 \\leq \\alpha \\leq 1\\), the \\(\\alpha\\)-quantile \\(q(\\alpha)\\) of the data is the datapoint \\(\\alpha\\) of the way along the list. So the median is the \\(\\frac12\\)-quantile \\(q(\\frac12)\\), the minimum is the 0-quantile \\(q(0)\\), and the maximum is the 1-quantile \\(q(1)\\). Generally, \\(q(\\alpha)\\) is equal to \\(x_{1+\\alpha(n-1)}\\) when \\(1+\\alpha(n-1)\\) is an integer. (If \\(1+\\alpha(n-1)\\) isn’t an integer, there are various conventions of how to choose that we won’t go into here. R has seven different settings for choosing quantiles! – we will always just use R’s default choice.) Two other common terms: \\(q(\\frac34)\\) is called the upper quartile and \\(q(\\frac14)\\) is called the lower quartile (note “quartile” – as in “quarter” – not “quantile”, here). The upper and lower quartiles of the \\(n = 13\\) Skittles packets are the \\(q(\\frac14) = x_4 = 59\\) and \\(x_{10} = 62\\). Some measures of spread are: Definition 1.2 The number of distinct observations is precisely that: the number of different datapoints you have after removing any repeats. The interquartile range is the difference between the upper and lower quartiles \\(\\text{IQR} = q(\\frac34) - q(\\frac14)\\). The sample variance is \\[ s^2_x = \\frac{1}{n-1} \\left((x_1 - \\bar x)^2 + \\cdots + (x_n - \\bar x)^2 \\right) = \\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar x)^2 , \\] where \\(\\bar x\\) is the sample mean from before. The standard deviation \\(s_x = \\sqrt{s^2_x}\\) is the square-root of the sample variance. The formula we’ve given for sample variance is sometimes called the “definitional formula”, as it’s the formula used to define the sample variance. We can rearrange that formula as follows: \\[\\begin{align*} s^2_x &amp;= \\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar x)^2 \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i^2 - 2x_i\\bar x + \\bar x^2) \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{1}{n-1}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^nx_i^2 - \\sum_{i=1}^n 2x_i\\bar x + \\sum_{i=1}^n\\bar x^2 \\right) \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{1}{n-1} \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 - 2\\bar x \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i + \\bar x^2 \\sum_{i=1}^n 1 \\right) \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{1}{n-1} \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 - 2n\\bar x^2 + n\\bar x^2 \\right) \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{1}{n-1} \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 - n\\bar x^2 \\right) . \\end{align*}\\] Here, the first line is the definitional formula; the second line is from expanding out the bracket; the third line is taking the sum term-by-term; the fourth line takes any constants (things not involving \\(i\\)) outside the sums; the fifth line uses \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i = n\\bar x\\), from the definition of the mean, and \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n 1 = 1 + 1 + \\cdots 1 = n\\); and the sixth line simplifies the final two terms. This has left us with \\[ s^2_x = \\frac{1}{n-1} \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 - n\\bar x^2 \\right) . \\] This is sometimes called the “computational formula”; this is because it’s usually more convenient to calculate the sample variance using this formula rather than the definitional formula. The following R code reads in some data which has the daily average temperature in Leeds in 2020, divided into months. We can find, for example, the mean October temperature or the sample variance of the July temperature. temperature &lt;- read.csv(&quot;https://mpaldridge.github.io/math1710/data/temperature.csv&quot;) jul &lt;- temperature[temperature$month == &quot;jul&quot;, ] oct &lt;- temperature[temperature$month == &quot;oct&quot;, ] mean(oct$temp) ## [1] 11.93548 var(jul$temp) ## [1] 12.03226 A boxplot is a useful way to illustrate data. It can be easier to tell the difference between different data sets “by eye” when looking at a boxplot, rather than examining raw summary statistics. A boxplot is drawn as follows: The vertical axis represents the data values. Draw a box from the lower quartile \\(q(\\frac14)\\) to the median \\(q(\\frac12)\\). Draw another box on top of this from the median \\(q(\\frac12)\\) to the upper quartile \\(q(\\frac34)\\). Note that size of these two boxes put together is the interquartile range. Decide which datapoints are outliers, and plot these with circles. (The R default is that any data point less than \\(q(\\frac14) - 1.5 \\times \\text{IQR}\\) or greater than \\(q(\\frac34) + 1.5 \\times \\text{IQR}\\) is an outlier.) Out from the two previous boxes, draw “whiskers” to the smallest and largest non-outlier datapoints. Here are two boxplots from the July and October temperature data. What do you conclude about the data from these boxplots? boxplot(jul$temp, oct$temp, names = c(&quot;July&quot;, &quot;October&quot;), ylab = &quot;Daily maximum temperature (degrees C) in Leeds&quot;) (And yes, I did check the outlier to make sure it was a genuine datapoint.) 1.4 Binned data and histograms Often when collecting data, we don’t collect exact data, but rather collect data clumped into “bins”. For example, suppose a student wished to use a questionnaire to collect data on how long it takes people to reach campus from home; they might not ask “Exactly how long does it take?”, but rather give a choice of tick boxes: “0–5 minutes”, “5–10 minutes”, and so on. Consider the following binned data, from \\(n = 100\\) students: Time Frequency Relative frequency 0–5 minutes 4 0.04 5–10 minutes 8 0.08 10–15 minutes 21 0.21 15–30 minutes 42 0.42 30–45 minutes 15 0.15 45–60 minutes 8 0.08 60–120 minutes 2 0.02 Total 100 1 Here the frequency \\(f_j\\) of bin \\(j\\) is simply the number of observations in that bin; so, for example, 42 students had journey lengths of between 15 and 30 minutes. The relative frequency of bin \\(j\\) is \\(f_j/n\\); that is, the proportion of the observations in that bin. What is the median journey length? Well, we don’t know exactly, but \\(0.04 + 0.08 + 0.21\\) (the first three bins) is less than 0.5, while \\(0.04 + 0.08 + 0.21 + 0.42\\) (including the fourth bin) is greater than 0.5. So we know that the median student is in the fourth bin, the “15–30 minute” bin, and we can say that the median journey length is between 15 and 30 minutes. What about the mode? The bin with the most observations in it is the “15–30 minute” bin. But this bin covers 15 minutes, while some of the other bins only cover 5 minutes. It would be a fairer comparison to look at the frequency density: the relative frequency divided by the size of the bin. Time Frequency Relative frequency Frequency density 0–5 minutes 4 0.04 0.008 5–10 minutes 8 0.08 0.016 10–15 minutes 21 0.21 0.042 15–30 minutes 42 0.42 0.028 30–45 minutes 15 0.15 0.010 45–60 minutes 8 0.08 0.005 60–120 minutes 2 0.02 0.0003 Total 100 1 In the first row, for example, the relative frequency is 0.04 and the size of the bin is 5 minutes, so the frequency density is \\(0.04/5 = 0.008\\). So the modal bin – the bin with the highest frequency density – is in fact the “10–15 minutes” bin. Since we don’t have the exact data, it’s not possible to exactly calculate the mean and variance. However, we can often get a good estimate by assuming that each observation was in fact right in the centre of its bin. So, for example, we can assume that all 4 observations in the “0–5 minutes” bin were journeys of exactly 2.5 minutes. Of course, this isn’t true (or is highly unlikely to be true), but we can often get a good approximation this way. For our journey-time data, our approximation of the mean would be \\[ \\bar x = \\frac{1}{100} \\big(4\\times 2.5 + 8 \\times 7.5 + \\cdots + 2\\times90) = 24.4 . \\] More generally, if \\(m_j\\) is the midpoint of bin \\(j\\) and \\(f_j\\) its frequency, then we can calculate the binned mean and binned variance by \\[\\begin{align*} \\bar x &amp;= \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_j f_j m_j \\\\ s^2_x &amp;= \\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_j f_j (m_j - \\bar x)^2 \\end{align*}\\] Data in bins can be illustrated with a histogram. A histogram has the measurement on the x-axis, with one bar across the width of each bin, with bars drawn up to the height of the corresponding frequency density. Note that this means that the area of the bar is exactly the relative frequency of the corresponding bin. (If all the bins are the same width, frequency density is directly proportional to frequency and to relative frequency, so it can be clearer use one of those as the y-axis instead.) Here is a histogram for our journey-time data: journeys &lt;- read.csv(&quot;https://mpaldridge.github.io/math1710/data/journeys.csv&quot;) bins &lt;- c(0, 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60, 120) hist(journeys$midpoint, breaks = bins, xlab = &quot;Journey length (min)&quot;, main = &quot;&quot;) Often we draw histograms because the data was collected in bins. But even when we have exact data, we might choose to divide it into bins for the purposes of drawing a histogram. In this case we have to decide where to put the “breaks” between the bins. Too many breaks too close together, and the small number of observations in each bin will give “noisy” results (see left); too few breaks too far apart, and the histogram will lose detail (see right). hist_data &lt;- c(rnorm(30, 8, 2), rnorm(40, 12, 3)) # Some fake data hist(hist_data, breaks = 40, main = &quot;Too many bins&quot;) hist(hist_data, breaks = 3, main = &quot;Too few bins&quot;) 1.5 Multiple variables and scatterplots Often, more than one piece of data is collected from each subject, and we wish to compare that data, to see if there is a relationship between the variables. For example, we could take \\(n\\) second-year maths students, and for each student \\(i\\), collect their mark \\(x_i\\) in MATH1710 and their mark \\(y_i\\) in MATH1712. This gives is two “paired” datasets, \\(\\mathbf x = (x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n)\\) and \\(\\mathbf y = (y_1, y_2, \\dots, y_n)\\). We can calculate sample statistics of draw plots for \\(\\mathbf x\\) and for \\(\\mathbf y\\) individually. But we might also want to see if there is a relationship between \\(\\mathbf x\\) and \\(\\mathbf y\\): Do students with high marks in MATH1710 also get high marks in MATH1712? A good way to visualise the relationship between two variables is to use a scatterplot. In a scatterplot, the \\(i\\)th data pair \\((x_i, y_i)\\) is illustrated with a mark (such as a circle or cross) whose x-coordinate has the value \\(x_i\\) and whose y-coordinate has the value \\(y_i\\). In the following scatterplot, we have \\(n = 50\\) datapoints for the 50 US states; for each state \\(i\\), \\(x_i\\) is the Republican share of the vote in that state in the 2016 Trump–Clinton presidential election, and \\(y_i\\) is the Republican share of the vote in that state in the 2020 Trump–Biden election. elections &lt;- read.csv(&quot;https://mpaldridge.github.io/math1710/data/elections.csv&quot;) plot(elections$X2016, elections$X2020, col = &quot;blue&quot;, xlab = &quot;Republican share of the two-party vote, 2016 (%)&quot;, ylab = &quot;Republican share of the two-party vote, 2020 (%)&quot;) abline(h = 50, col = &quot;grey&quot;) abline(v = 50, col = &quot;grey&quot;) abline(0.195, 0.963, col = &quot;red&quot;) We see that there is a strong relationship between \\(\\mathbf x\\) and \\(\\mathbf y\\), with high values of \\(x\\) corresponding to high values of \\(y\\) and vice versa. Further, the points on the scatterplot lie very close to a straight line. A useful summary statistic here is the correlation \\[ r_{xy} = \\frac{s_{xy}}{s_x s_y} , \\] where \\(s_{xy}\\) is the sample covariance \\[ s_{xy} = \\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar x)(y_i - \\bar y) , \\] and \\(s_x\\) and \\(s_y\\) are the standard deviations. The correlation \\(r_{xy}\\) is always between \\(-1\\) and \\(+1\\). Values of \\(r_{xy}\\) near \\(+1\\) indicate that the scatterpoints are close to a straight line with an upward slope (big \\(x\\) = big \\(y\\)); values of \\(r_{xy}\\) near \\(-1\\) indicate that the scatterpoints are close to a straight line with a downward slope (big \\(x\\) = small \\(y\\)); and values of \\(r_{xy}\\) near 0 indicate that there is a weak linear relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). For the elections data, the correlation is cor(elections$X2016, elections$X2020) ## [1] 0.9919659 which, as we expected, is extremely high. Summary Exploratory data analysis is about taking a first look at data. Summary statistics are numbers calculated from data that give us useful information about the data. Summary statistics that measure the centre of the data include the mode, median, and mean. Summary statistics that measure the spread of the data include the number of distinct outcomes, the interquartile range, and the sample variance. A summary statistic that measures the linear relationship between two variables is the correlation. Boxplots, histograms, and scatterplots are useful ways of visualising data. "],["P1.html", "Problem Sheet 1 A: Short questions B: Long questions C: Assessed questions Solutions to short questions", " Problem Sheet 1 .myanswers { display: none !important; } This is Problem Sheet 1, which covers material from Section 1 of the notes. You should work through all the questions on this problem sheet during Week 1, in preparation for your tutorial in Week 2. Questions C1 and C2 are assessed questions, and are due in by 2pm on Monday 11 October. I recommend spending about 3 hours on this problem sheet in Week 1, plus 1 extra hour in Week 2 to neatly write up and submit your answers to the assessed questions. A: Short questions The first two questions are short questions, which are intended to be mostly not too difficult. Short questions usually follow directly from the material in the notes. Here, your should clearly state your final answer, and give enough working-out (or a short written explanation) for it to be clear how you reached that answer. You can check your answers with the solutions-without-working at the bottom of this sheet; solutions-with-working will be available later. If you get stuck on any of these questions, you might want to ask for guidance in your tutorial. A1. Consider again the “number of Skittles in each packet” data from Example 1.1. \\[ 59, \\ 59, \\ 59, \\ 59, \\ 60, \\ 60, \\ 60, \\ 61, \\ 62, \\ 62, \\ 62, \\ 63, \\ 63 .\\] (a) Calculate the mean number of Skittles in each packet. Solution. This was in the notes: \\[ \\bar x = \\frac{1}{13} (59 + 59 + \\cdots + 63) = \\frac{789}{13} = 60.7 .\\] (b) Calculate the sample variance using the computational formula. Solution. \\[\\begin{align*} s_x^2 &amp;= \\frac{1}{13 - 1} \\left( (59^2 + 59^2 + \\cdots + 63^2) - 13 \\times 60.6923^2)\\right) \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{1}{12} (47915 - 47886.2) \\\\ &amp;= 2.40 \\end{align*}\\] Group feedback: With the computational formula, the value \\(\\sum_i x_i^2 - n \\bar{x}^2\\) is typically a fairly small number given as the difference between two very big numbers \\(\\sum_i x_i^2\\) and \\(n \\bar x^2\\). This means you have to get the two big numbers very precise, to ensure the cancellation happens correctly; in particular, make sure you use plenty of decimal places of accuracy in \\(\\bar x\\). (c) Calculate the sample variance using the definitional formula. Solution. \\[\\begin{align*} s_x^2 &amp;= \\frac{1}{13 - 1} \\left( (59 - 60.7)^2 + (59 - 60.7)^2 + \\cdots + (63 - 60.7)^2 \\right) \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{1}{12} (2.86 + 2.86 + \\cdots + 5.33) \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{1}{12} \\times 28.77 \\\\ &amp;= 2.40 \\end{align*}\\] (d) Out of (b) and (c), which calculation did you find easier, and why? Solution. The computational formula required fewer presses of the calculator buttons, because \\(\\sum_i x_i^2\\) is fewer button-presses than \\(\\sum_i (x_i - \\bar x)^2\\), where you have to subtract the means before squaring. On the other hand, the expression inside the brackets of the computational formula is a fairly small number given as the difference of two very large numbers, so it was necessary to use lots of decimal places of accuracy in \\(\\bar x\\) to make sure the second large number was accurate and therefore that the subtraction cancelled correctly. A2. Consider the following data sets of the age of elected politicians on a local council. (The “18–30” consists of people older than and including 18, and younger than but not including 30.) Age (years) Frequency Relative frequency Frequency density 18–30 1 30–40 3 40–45 4 45–50 5 50–55 3 55–60 1 60–70 3 Total 20 1 — (a) Complete the table by filling in the relative frequency and frequency densities. Solution. Age (years) Frequency Relative frequency Frequency density 18–30 1 0.05 0.0041 30–40 3 0.15 0.015 40–45 4 0.2 0.04 45–50 5 0.25 0.05 50–55 3 0.15 0.03 55–60 1 0.05 0.01 60–70 3 0.15 0.015 Total 20 1 — (b) What is the median age bin? Solution. The 10th- and 11th-largest observations are both in the 45–50 bin, which is therefore the median bin. (c) Calculate (an approximation of) the mean age of the politicians. Solution. Pretending that each person is in the centre of their bin, we have \\[ \\bar x = \\frac{1}{20} (1\\times24 + 3\\times 35 + \\cdots + 3 \\times 65) = \\frac{946.5}{20} = 47.3 . \\] B: Long questions The next four questions are long questions, which are intended to be harder. Long questions often require you to think originally for yourself, not just directly follow procedures from the notes. Here, your answers should be written in complete sentences, and you should carefully explain in words each step of your working. Your answers to these questions – not only their mathematical content, but also how to clearly write good solutions – are likely to be the main topic for discussion in your tutorial. B1. For each of the two datasets below, calculate the following summary statistics, or explain why it is not possible to do so: mode; median; mean; number of distinct outcomes; inter-quartile range; and sample variance. (a) Six packets of Skittles are opened together, and the total number of sweets of each colour is: Colour Red Orange Yellow Green Purple Number of Skittles 67 71 87 74 62 Solution. The modal colour is Yellow. The number of distinct outcomes is 5. It’s not possible to calculate the median or the quartiles, because, unlike numerical data, the colours can’t be put “in order” from smallest to largest. It’s not possible to calculate the mean or sample variance, as these require us to have numerical data that can be “added up”, but this can’t be done with colours. (b) Shirt sizes for a university football squad: Colour Xtra Small Small Medium Large Xtra Large Number of shirts 0 1 6 4 5 [Note: This has been corrected from an earlier version, where the 4 Large and 5 Xtra Large were the wrong way round.] Solution. The modal shirt size is medium. The number of distinct outcomes is 4 (we don’t quite “Xtra Small”, which was not observed in the data). This time, we can order the data from smallest to largest, even though the data is not numerical. Since \\((16 + 1)/2 - 8.5\\), the median datapoint is the 8th or 9th datapoints, which are Large. Since \\(1 + 0.25(16 - 1) = 4.75\\) the lower quartile is the 4th or 5th datapoints, which are Medium. Since \\(1 + 0.75(16-1) = 12.25\\), the upper quartile is the 12th or 13th datapoints, which are Xtra Large. So we can certainly say that the inner quartiles range from Medium to Xtra Large. We could probably also say that the interquartile range is 3 shirt sizes (Medium, Large, Xtra Large). Again, because the data is not numerical, we can’t add it up, so can’t calculate a mean or sample variance. Group feedback: Make sure your explanation is clear for why we can’t calculate a median for the Skittles data but can for the shirts: they key is whether or not the data can be ordered. B2. A summary statistic is informally said to be “robust” if it typically doesn’t change much if a small number of outliers are introduced to a large dataset, or “sensitive” if it often changes a lot when a small number of outliers are introduced. Briefly discuss the robustness or sensitivity of the following summary statistics: (a) mode; (b) median; (c) mean; (d) number of distinct outcomes; (e) inter-quartile range; and (f) sample variance. Solutions. (a) The mode will typically not change at all if a small number of outliers are introduced, so is robust. (The exception is for data where every observation is likely to be different, so the outliers become “joint modes” along with everything else; but in this case the mode is not a useful statistic in the first place.) (b) The introduction of outliers will typically only change the median a little bit, by shifting it between different nearby values in the “central mass” of the data. In particular, the size of the outliers won’t make any difference at all (only whether they are “high outliers” or “low outliers”). So the median is robust. (c) The mean can change a lot is outliers are introduced. (Think about the mean net worth of people in you tutorial group, and how it would change if Jeff Bezos or Elon Musk joined your tutorial group.) So the mean is sensitive. (d) The number of distinct outcomes will only increase by (at most) 1 for each outlier introduced, so is robust. (e) The interquartile range is robust, for the same reason as the median. (f) The sample variance is sensitive, for the same reason as the mean. (You might like to think about situations where it’s better to use a robust statistic or better to use a sensitive statistic.) Group feedback: Remember that “robust” and “sensitive” are general descriptions rather than precise mathematical definitions. So it doesn’t matter if you disagree with my opinions provided that you give clear and detailed explanations to back up your opinion. B3. Let \\(\\mathbf a = (a_1, a_2, \\dots a_n)\\) and \\(\\mathbf b = (b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_n)\\) be two real-valued vectors of the same length. Then the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality says that \\[ \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i b_i \\right)^2 \\leq \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2 \\right) \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n b_i^2 \\right) . \\] Use the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality to show that the correlation \\(r_{xy}\\) satisfies \\(-1 \\leq r_{xy} \\leq 1\\). (Hint: Try to prove that \\(s_{xy}^2 \\leq s_x^2 s_y^2\\). How does this help?) Solutions. The first thing we want do is get from the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality \\[ \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i b_i \\right)^2 \\leq \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2 \\right) \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n b_i^2 \\right) . \\] to the hint \\(s_{xy}^2 \\leq s_x^2 s_y^2\\). We’ll do this by making a clever choice for \\((a_i)\\) and \\((b_i)\\) in Cauchy–Schwarz that tells us something useful about \\(s_{xy}\\), \\(s_x^2\\), and \\(s_y^2\\). Recalling the formulas for \\(s_{xy}\\), \\(s_x^2\\), and \\(s_y^2\\), \\[\\begin{align*} s_{xy} &amp;= \\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar x)(y_i - \\bar y) ,\\\\ s_{x}^2 &amp;= \\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar x)^2 ,\\\\ s_{y}^2 &amp;= \\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\bar y)^2 , \\end{align*}\\] and comparing them with the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality, it looks like taking \\(a_i = x_i - \\bar x\\) and \\(b_i = y_i - \\bar y\\) might be useful. Making the substitution, we get \\[ \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar x)(y_i - \\bar y) \\right)^2 \\leq \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar x)^2 \\right) \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\bar y)^2 \\right) . \\] These are very close to the formulas for \\(s_{xy}\\), \\(s_x^2\\), and \\(s_y^2\\), but are just missing the “\\(1/(n-1)\\)”s; what we in fact have is \\[ \\left( (n-1) s_{xy} \\right)^2 \\leq (n-1)s_x^2 \\cdot (n-1) s_y^2 .\\] Cancelling \\((n-1)^2\\) from each side, we have \\(s_{xy}^2 \\leq s_x^2 s_y^2\\), and we’ve proved the hint. We now want to get from the hint to the desired statement \\(-1 \\leq r_{xy} \\leq 1\\). Recall the formula for the correlation is \\[ r_{xy} = \\frac{s_{xy}}{s_xs_y} . \\] We can make the hint look a bit like this dividing both sides by \\(s_x^2 s_y^2\\), to get \\[\\frac{s_{xy}^2}{s_x^2 s_y^2} \\leq 1. \\] In fact that’s the square of the correlation on the left-hand side, so we’ve shown that \\(r_{xy}^2 \\leq 1\\). Finally, we note that if a number squared is less than or equal to 1, then the number must be between -1 and +1 inclusive. (Numbers bigger than 1 get bigger still when squared; number smalles than -1 become bigger than +1 when squared.) Hence we have shown that \\(-1 \\leq r_{xy} \\leq 1\\), as required. Group feedback: There are two halves to this question: first get from the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality to the hint, and second get from the hint to the answer \\(-1 \\leq r_{xy} \\leq 1\\). Many students struggled with the first half – but you can still try to do the second half. Especially in an exam, look for places where you can get marks for doing part of the question – and it doesn’t need to be the first part! B4. A researcher wishes to study the effect of mental health on academic achievement. The researcher will collect data on the mental health of a cohort of students by asking them to fill in a questionnaire, and will measure academic achievement via the students’ scores on their university exams. Discuss some of the ethical issues associated with the collection, storage, and analysis of this data, and with the publication of the results of the analysis. Are there ways to mitigate these issues? (It’s not necessary to write an essay for this question – a few short bulletpoints will suffice. There may be an opportunity to discuss these issues in more detail in your tutorial.) Group feedback: There are no “correct” or “incorrect” answers here, but here are a few things that students in my own tutorials brought up, which may act as a prompt for your own discussions. It’s important the students/subjects have given their consent for their data to be used this way. It must be “informed consent”, where they understand for what purpose the data will be used, how it will be stored, and so on. It must be possible and painless for students to decline to take part. Consideration should be given on how to anonymise the data as much as possible – it’s not necessary for those analysing the data to know which questionnaire or which exam result belongs to which student, only that the questionnaire and results can be paired up. Even if after data is anonymised, care should be taken about whether the students could be worked out from the data. For example, if only one student did a certain combination of modules, their identity could “leak” that way. Perhaps imprecise data, such as classes rather than exact marks, might help while only slightly reducing the usefulness of the data? On one hand, it seems like this data should perhaps be deleted once analysis has been carried out, for the privacy of the students. On the other hand, principles of “open science” suggest that the data should be kept – and even publically made available – for other researchers to check the work. There are competing ethical considerations here. If correlations are found in the data, care should be taken when publishing the analysis not to wrongly suggest a causation. (Just because X and Y are positively correlated, it doesn’t mean that X causes Y – or that Y causes X.) You can probably think of many other things. C: Assessed questions The last two questions are assessed questions. This means you will submit your answers, and your answers will be marked by your tutor. These two questions count for 3% of your final mark for this module. If you get stuck, your tutor may be willing to give you a hint in your tutorial. The deadline for submitting your solutions is 2pm on Monday 11 October at the beginning of Week 3, although I strongly recommend completing and submitting your work during Week 2. Submission will be via Gradescope; submission will open on Monday 4 October. You should submit your answers as a single PDF file. Most students choose to hand-write their work, then scan it to PDF using their phone; if you do this, you should use a proper scanning app (like Microsoft Lens or Adobe Scan) – please do not just submit photographs. We will discuss Gradescope submission further in the Week 2 lectures. Your work will be marked by your tutor and returned on Monday 18 September, when solutions will also be made available. Question C1 is a “short question”, where brief explanations or working are sufficient; Question C2 is a “long question”, where the marks are not only for mathematical accuracy but also for the clarity and completeness of your explanations. You should not collaborate with others on the assessed questions: your answers must represent solely your own work. The University’s rules on academic integrity – and the related punishments for violating them – apply to your work on the assessed questions. C1. The monthly average exchange rate for US dollars into British pounds over a 12-month period was: \\[\\begin{gather*} 1.306, \\ 1.301, \\ 1.290, \\ 1.266, \\ 1.290, \\ 1.302,\\\\ 1.317, \\ 1.304, \\ 1.284, \\ 1.268, \\ 1.247, \\ 1.215. \\end{gather*}\\] (a) Calculate the median for this data. (b) Calculate the mean for this data. (c) Calculate the sample variance for this data. Hints. Have you checked the definitions of these statistics from Subsection 1.3 of the notes? (d) Is the mode an appropriate summary statistic for this data? Why/why not? Hint. Is there a unique mode for this data? Why not? C2.  (a) Prove the following computational formula for the sample covariance: \\[ s_{xy} = \\frac{1}{n-1} \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^n x_iy_i - n\\bar x \\bar y \\right). \\] Hint. In Subsection 1.3 of the notes, we went from the definitional formula for the sample variance to a computational formula. Can you follow a similar argument here? (b) Suppose that a dataset \\(\\mathbf x = (x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n)\\) (with \\(n \\geq 2\\)) has sample variance \\(s_x^2 = 0\\). Show that all the datapoints are in fact equal. Hint. When is the square of something equal to 0? What can you say about the value of a square when it’s nonzero? What can you say about a “sum of squares” – that is, some numbers squared then added together? Solutions to short questions A1. (a) 60.7 (b) &amp; (c) 2.40 (d) — A2. (a) — (b) 45–50 (c) 47.3 "],["S02-probability.html", "Section 2 Probability spaces 2.1 What is probability? 2.2 Sample spaces and events 2.3 Basic set theory 2.4 Probability axioms 2.5 Properties of probability 2.6 Addition rules for unions Summary", " Section 2 Probability spaces 2.1 What is probability? We now begin the big central block of this module, on probability theory. Probability theory is the study of randomness. Probability, as an area of mathematics, is a fascinating subject in its own right. However, probability is particularly important due to its usefulness in applications – especially in statistics (the study of data), in finance, and in actuarial science (the study of insurance). Probability is well suited to modelling situations that involve randomness, uncertainty, or unpredictability. If we you want to predict the time of the next solar eclipse, a deterministic (that is, non-random) model based on physical laws will tell you when the sun, the moon, and the earth will be in the correct positions; but if you want to predict the weather tomorrow, or the price of a share of Apple stock next month, or the results of an election next year, you will need a probabilistic model that takes into account the uncertainty in the outcome. A probabilistic model could tell you the most likely outcome, or a range of the most probable outcomes. So what do we mean when we talk about the “probability” of an event occurring? You might say that the probability of an event is a measure of “how likely” it is to occur, or what the “chance” of it occurring is. More concretely, here are some interpretations of probability: Subjective (or Bayesian) probability: The probability of an event is the way someone expresses their degree of belief that the event will occur, based on their own judgement, and given the evidence they have seen. Their belief is measured on a scale from 0 to 1, from probabilities near 0 meaning they believe the event is very unlikely to occur to probabilities near 1 meaning they believe the event is very likely to occur. This interpretation is philosophically sound, but a bit vague to be the basis for a mathematics module. Classical (or enumerative) probability: Suppose there are a finite number of equally likely outcomes. Then the probability of an event is the proportion of those outcomes that correspond to the event occurring. So when we say that a randomly dealt card has a probability \\(\\frac{1}{13}\\) of being an ace, this is because there are 52 cards of which 4 are aces, so the proportion of favourable outcomes is \\(\\frac{4}{52} = \\frac{1}{13}\\). This interpretation is good for simple procedures like flipping a fair coin, rolling a dice, or dealing cards, where the “finite number of equally likely outcomes” assumption holds. But we want to be able to study more complicated situations, where some outcomes are more likely than others, or where infinitely many different outcomes are possible. Frequentist probability: In a repeated experiment, the probability of an event is its long-run frequency. That is, if we repeat an experiment a very large number of times, the probability of the event is (approximately) the proportion of the experiments in which the event occurs. So when we say a biased coin has probability 0.9 of landing heads, we mean that were we toss it 1000 times, we would expect to see very close to \\(0.9 \\times 1000 = 900\\) heads. There are two problems with this. First, this doesn’t deal with events that can’t be repeated over and over again (like “What’s the probability that England win the 2022 World Cup?”). Second, to answer the question, “Yes, but how close to the probability should the proportion of occurrences be?”, you end up having to answer, “Well, it depends on the probability,” and you’ve got a circular definition. Mathematical probability: We have a function that assigns to each event a number between 0 and 1, called its probability, and that function has to obey certain mathematical rules, called “axioms”. It will not surprise you to learn that, in this mathematics course, we will take the “mathematical probability” approach. However, we will also learn useful things about the other approaches: we will see that classical probability is one special case of mathematical probability; we will see a result called the “law of large numbers” that says that the long-run frequency does indeed get closer and closer to the mathematical probability; and a result called “Bayes’ theorem” will advise a subjectivist on how to update her subjective beliefs when she sees new evidence. 2.2 Sample spaces and events Taking the “mathematical probability” approach, we will want to give a formal mathematical definition of the probability of an event. But even before that, we need to give a formal mathematical definition of an event itself. Our setup will be this: There is a set called the sample space, normally given the letter \\(\\Omega\\) (upper-case Omega), which is the set of all possible outcomes. An element of the sample space \\(\\Omega\\) is a sample outcome, sometimes given the letter \\(\\omega\\) (lower-case omega), represents one of the possible outcomes. An event is a set of sample outcomes; that is, a subset of the sample space \\(\\Omega\\). Events are often given letters like \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\). We write \\(A \\subset \\Omega\\) to mean that \\(A\\) is an event in (or, equivalently, is a subset of) the sample space \\(\\Omega\\). This will be easier to understand with some concrete examples. We write a set (such as a sample space or an event) by writing all the elements of that set inside curly brackets \\(\\{\\ \\}\\), separated by commas. Example 2.1 Suppose we toss a (possibly biased) coin, and record whether it lands heads or tails. Then our sample space is \\(\\Omega = \\{\\mathrm H, \\mathrm T\\}\\), where the sample outcome H denotes heads and the sample outcome T denotes tails. The event that the coin lands heads is \\(\\{\\mathrm H\\}\\). Example 2.2 Suppose we roll a dice, and record the number rolled. Then our sample space is \\(\\Omega = \\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}\\), where the sample outcome \\(1\\) corresponds to rolling a one, and so on. The event “we roll an even number” is \\(\\{2,4,6\\}\\). The event “we roll at least a five” is \\(\\{5,6\\}\\). Example 2.3 Suppose we wish to count how many claims are made to an insurance company in a year. We could model this by taking the sample space \\(\\Omega\\) to be \\(\\mathbb Z_+ = \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots\\}\\), the set of all non-negative integers. The event “the company receives less than 1000 claims” is \\(\\{0, 1, 2, \\dots, 998, 999\\}\\). Example 2.4 Suppose we want a computer to pick a random number between 0 and 1. We could model this by taking the sample space \\(\\Omega\\) to be the interval \\([0, 1]\\) of all real numbers between 0 and 1. The event “the number is bigger than \\(\\frac12\\)” is the sub-interval \\((\\frac12, 1]\\) of all real numbers greater than \\(\\frac12\\) but no bigger than 1. The event “the first digit is a 7” is the sub-interval \\([0.7, 0.8)\\). The event “the random number is exactly \\(1/\\sqrt{2}\\)” is \\(\\{1/\\sqrt{2}\\}\\). In the first two examples, the sample space \\(\\Omega\\) was finite. In third example, the sample space was infinite but “countably infinite”, in that it could be counted using the discrete values of the positive integers. Both of these were for counting discrete observations. In the fourth example, the sample space was infinite but “uncountably infinite”, in that it had a sliding scale or “continuum” of gradually varying measurements. This was for measuring continuous observations. This distinction will be important later in the course. For any sample space \\(\\Omega\\), there are two special events that always exist. There’s \\(\\Omega\\) itself, the event containing all of the sample outcomes, which represents “something happens”. There’s also the empty set \\(\\varnothing\\), which contains none of the sample outcomes, which represents “nothing happens”. Common sense suggests that \\(\\Omega\\) should have probability 1, because something is bound to happen – this will later be one of our probability “axioms”. Common sense also suggests that \\(\\varnothing\\) should have probability 0, because it can’t be that nothing happens – this will not be one probability axioms, but we’ll show that it follows logically from the axioms we do choose. 2.3 Basic set theory Since we’ve now defined events as being sets – specifically, subsets of the sample space \\(\\Omega\\) – it will be useful to mention a little set theory here. First, there are ways we can build new sets (or events) out of old. It’s fine to just read the words and look at the pictures for these definitions, but those who want to read the equations too will need to know this: \\(\\omega \\in A\\) means “\\(\\omega\\) is in \\(A\\)” or “\\(\\omega\\) is an element of \\(A\\)”, while \\(\\omega \\not\\in A\\) means the opposite: \\(\\omega\\) is not in \\(A\\); a colon \\(:\\) in the middle of set notation should be read as “such that”; so \\(\\{\\omega \\in \\Omega : \\text{fact about $\\omega$}\\}\\) should be read as “the set of sample points \\(\\omega\\) in the sample space \\(\\Omega\\) such that the fact is true”. Definition 2.1 Consider a sample space \\(\\Omega\\), and let \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) be events in that sample space. NOT: The complement of \\(A\\), written \\(A^\\mathsf{c}\\) (and said “\\(A\\) complement” or “not \\(A\\)”), is the set of sample points not in \\(A\\); that is \\[ A^\\mathsf{c}= \\{\\omega \\in \\Omega : \\omega \\not\\in A \\} . \\] This represents the event that \\(A\\) does not occur. AND: The intersection of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), written \\(A \\cap B\\) (and said “\\(A\\) intersect \\(B\\)” or “\\(A\\) and \\(B\\)”) is the set of sample points in both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\); that is, \\[ A \\cap B = \\{\\omega \\in \\Omega : \\omega \\in A \\text{ and } \\omega \\in B \\} . \\] This represents the event that both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) occur. OR: The union of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), written \\(A \\cup B\\) (and said “\\(A\\) union \\(B\\)” or “\\(A\\) or \\(B\\)”) is the set of sample points in \\(A\\) or in \\(B\\); that is, \\[ A \\cup B = \\{\\omega \\in \\Omega : \\omega \\in A \\text{ or } \\omega \\in B \\} . \\] This represents the event that \\(A\\) occurs or \\(B\\) occurs. (In mathematics, “or” includes “both”, so a sample outcome in both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) is in \\(A\\cup B\\) too.)   Example 2.5 Suppose we are rolling a dice, so our sample space is \\(\\Omega = \\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}\\). Let \\(A = \\{2,4,6\\}\\) be the event that we roll and even number, and let \\(B = \\{5,6\\}\\) be the event that we roll at least a 5. Then \\[\\begin{align*} A^\\mathsf{c}&amp;= \\{1,3,5\\} = \\{\\text{roll an odd number}\\} ,\\\\ A \\cap B &amp;= \\{6\\} = \\{\\text{roll a 6}\\} ,\\\\ A \\cup B &amp;= \\{2,4,5,6\\} . \\end{align*}\\] An important case is when two events \\(A, B\\) cannot happen at the same time; that is, \\(A \\cap B = \\varnothing\\) (“\\(A\\) intersect \\(B\\) is the empty set”). In this case, we say that \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are disjoint or mutually exclusive. For example, when \\(\\Omega\\) is a deck of cards, then \\(A = \\{\\text{the card is a spade}\\}\\) and \\(B = \\{\\text{the card is red}\\}\\) are disjoint, because a card cannot be both a spade (a black suit) and red. There are a few rules about combining the complement, intersection and union operations. The double complement law tells us that not-not-\\(A\\) is the same as \\(A\\): \\[ (A^\\mathsf{c})^\\mathsf{c}= A .\\] This says that if it’s not “not-raining”, then it’s raining! The distributive laws tells us we can “mutiply out of the brackets brackets” with sets: \\[\\begin{align*} A \\cap (B \\cup C) &amp;= (A \\cap B) \\cup (A \\cap C) ,\\\\ A \\cup (B \\cap C) &amp;= (A \\cup B) \\cap (A \\cup C) . \\end{align*}\\] De Morgan’s laws tell us how complements interact with intersection/unions: \\[\\begin{align*} (A \\cap B)^\\mathsf{c}&amp;= A^\\mathsf{c}\\cup B^\\mathsf{c}\\\\ (A \\cup B)^\\mathsf{c}&amp;= A^\\mathsf{c}\\cap B^\\mathsf{c} \\end{align*}\\] The first of these says that if it’s not a Monday in October, then either it’s not Monday or it’s not October (or both). The second says that if a maths lecture is not “useful or fun”, then it’s not useful and it’s not fun. If you ever do need to prove one of these statements (or a similar one) you can use a Venn diagram or a truth table. Let’s prove the second distributive law, \\[ A \\cup (B \\cap C) = (A \\cup B) \\cap (A \\cup C) , \\] with a Venn diagram. We can build the left-hand side of the law as:     The left-hand figure is \\(\\color{orange}{A}\\), the middle figure is \\(\\color{purple}{B\\cap C}\\), and the right-hand figure is union of these, \\(A\\cup (B\\cap C)\\). Then for the right-hand side of the law, we have:     The left-hand figure is \\(\\color{orange}{A} \\cup \\color{blue}{B}\\), the middle figure is \\(\\color{orange}{A}\\cup \\color{red}{C}\\), and the right-hand figure is intersection of these, \\((A\\cup B)\\cap (A\\cup C)\\). We see that the areas shaded in two right-hand figures are the same, so it is indeed the case that \\(A\\cup (B\\cap C) = (A\\cup B)\\cap (A\\cup C)\\). Let’s also prove the first of De Morgan’s laws, \\[ (A \\cap B)^\\mathsf{c}= A^\\mathsf{c}\\cup B^\\mathsf{c}, \\] this time using a truth table. (This bit might be more clear from the video above, from 14:30.) We start with a table like this, with the four possibilities of whether \\(A\\) and/or \\(B\\) are true: \\(A\\) \\(B\\) \\(A\\cap B\\) \\((A \\cap B)^\\mathsf{c}\\) \\(A^\\mathsf{c}\\) \\(B^\\mathsf{c}\\) \\(A^\\mathsf{c}\\cup B^\\mathsf{c}\\) False False False True True False True True We fill in the first half to find a column for the left-hand side of the law \\((A \\cap B)^\\mathsf{c}\\): \\(A\\) \\(B\\) \\(A\\cap B\\) \\((A \\cap B)^\\mathsf{c}\\) \\(A^\\mathsf{c}\\) \\(B^\\mathsf{c}\\) \\(A^\\mathsf{c}\\cup B^\\mathsf{c}\\) False False False True False True False True True False False True True True True False and the second half to find a column for the right-hand side of the law \\(A^\\mathsf{c}\\cup B^\\mathsf{c}\\). \\(A\\) \\(B\\) \\(A\\cap B\\) \\((A \\cap B)^\\mathsf{c}\\) \\(A^\\mathsf{c}\\) \\(B^\\mathsf{c}\\) \\(A^\\mathsf{c}\\cup B^\\mathsf{c}\\) False False False True True True True False True False True True False True True False False True False True True True True True False False False False Since the \\((A \\cap B)^\\mathsf{c}\\) column and the \\(A^\\mathsf{c}\\cup B^\\mathsf{c}\\) column are the same, these must be the same sets. 2.4 Probability axioms Recall that, in this mathematics course, a probability will be a real number that satisfies certain properties, which we call axioms. Definition 2.2 Let \\(\\Omega\\) be a sample space. A probability measure on \\(\\Omega\\) is a function \\(\\mathbb P\\) that assigns to each event \\(A \\subset \\Omega\\) a real number \\(\\mathbb P(A)\\), called the probability of \\(A\\), and that satisfies the following three axioms: \\(\\mathbb P(A) \\geq 0\\) for all events \\(A \\subset \\Omega\\); \\(\\mathbb P(\\Omega) = 1\\); if \\(A_1, A_2, \\dots\\) is a finite or infinite sequence of disjoint events, then \\[ \\mathbb P(A_1 \\cup A_2 \\cup \\cdots) = \\mathbb P(A_1) + \\mathbb P(A_2) + \\cdots . \\] The sample space \\(\\Omega\\) together with the probability measure \\(\\mathbb P\\) are called a probability space. Axiom 1 says that all probabilities are non-negative numbers. Axiom 2 says the probability that something happens is 1. Axiom 3 says that for disjoint events the probability that one of them happens is the sum of the individual probabilities. (Those who like their mathematical statements super-precise should note that an infinite sequence in Axiom 3 must “countable”; that is, indexed by the natural numbers \\(1, 2, 3. \\dots\\).) These axioms of probability (and our later results that follow from them) were first written down by the Russian mathematician Andrey Nikolaevich Kolmogorov in 1933. This marked the point from when probability theory could now be considered a proper branch of mathematics – just as legitimate as geometry or number theory – and not just a past-time that can be useful to help gamblers calculate their odds. I always find it surprising that the axioms of probability are less than 90 years old! There are other properties that it seems natural that a probability measure should have aside from the axioms – for example, that \\(\\mathbb P(A) \\leq 1\\) for all events \\(A\\). But we will show shortly that other properties can be proven just by starting from the three axioms. But first, let’s see some examples. Example 2.6 Suppose we wish to model tossing an biased coin the is heads with probability \\(p\\), where \\(0 \\leq p \\leq 1\\). Our probability space is \\(\\Omega = \\{\\text{H}, \\text{T}\\}\\). The probability measure is given by \\[\\begin{align*} \\mathbb P(\\varnothing) &amp;= 0 &amp; \\mathbb P(\\{\\text{H}\\}) &amp;= p \\\\ \\mathbb P(\\{\\text{T}\\}) &amp;= 1 - p &amp; \\mathbb P(\\{\\text{H},\\text{T}\\}) &amp;= 1 . \\end{align*}\\] Let’s check that the axioms hold: Since \\(0 \\leq p \\leq 1\\), all the probabilites are greater than or equal to 0. It is indeed the case that \\(\\mathbb P(\\Omega) = \\mathbb P(\\{\\text{H},\\text{T}\\}) = 1\\). The only nontrivial disjoint union to check is \\(\\{\\text{H}\\} \\cup \\{\\text{T}\\} = \\{\\text{H},\\text{T}\\}\\). But \\[ \\mathbb P(\\{\\text{H}\\}) + \\mathbb P(\\{\\text{T}\\}) = p + (1 - p) = 1 = \\mathbb P(\\{\\text{H},\\text{T}\\}) , \\] as required. Example 2.7 Suppose we wish to model rolling a dice. Our sample space is \\(\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}\\). The probability measure is given by \\[ \\mathbb P(A) = \\frac{|A|}{6} , \\] where \\(|A|\\) is the number of sample outcomes in \\(A\\). So, for example, the probability of rolling an even number is \\[ \\mathbb P(\\{2,4,6\\}) = \\frac36 = \\frac12 . \\] The dice rolling is a particular case of the “classical probability” of equally likely outcomes. We’ll look at this more in the next section, next week, and prove that the classical probability measure does indeed satisfy the axioms 2.5 Properties of probability The axioms of Definition 2.2 only gave us some of the properties that we would like a probability measure to have. Our task now (in this subsection and the next) is to carefully prove how these other properties follow from just those axioms. In particular, we’re not allowed to make claims that “seem likely to be true” or “are common sense” – we can only use the three axioms together with logical deductions and nothing else. Theorem 2.1 Let \\(\\Omega\\) be a sample space with a probability measure \\(\\mathbb P\\). Then we have the following: \\(\\mathbb P(\\varnothing) = 0\\). \\(\\mathbb P(A^\\mathsf{c}) = 1 - \\mathbb P(A)\\) for all events \\(A \\subset \\Omega\\). For events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) with \\(B \\subset A\\), we have \\(\\mathbb P(B) \\leq \\mathbb P(A)\\). \\(0 \\leq \\mathbb P(A) \\leq 1\\) for all events \\(A \\subset \\Omega\\). Importantly, the third result here tells us how to deal with complements or “not” events: the probability of \\(A\\) not happening is 1 minus the probability it does happen. This is often very useful. Proof. Statements 1 and 2 are exercise for you on Problem Sheet 2. We’ll start with the third statement. The key with most of these “prove from the axioms” problems is to think of a way to write the relevant events as part of a disjoint union, then use Axiom 3. Here, since \\(B\\) is a subset of \\(A\\), it would be useful to write \\(A\\) as a disjoint union of \\(B\\) and \"the bit of \\(A\\) that isn’t in \\(B\\). That is, we have the disjoint union \\[ B \\cup (A \\cap B^\\mathsf{c}) = A .\\] Applying Axiom 3 to this disjoint union gives \\[ \\mathbb P(B) + \\mathbb P(A \\cap B^\\mathsf{c}) = \\mathbb P(A) . \\] We’re happy to see the first term on the left-hand side and the term on the right-hand side. But what about the awkward \\(\\mathbb P(A \\cap B^\\mathsf{c})\\)? Well, by Axiom 1, we know that \\(\\mathbb P(A \\cap B^\\mathsf{c}) \\geq 0\\), and hence \\[ \\mathbb P(B) + 0 \\leq \\mathbb P(A) , \\] and we are done with the third statement. For the fourth statement, we have \\(\\mathbb P(A) \\geq 0\\) directly from Axiom 1, so only need to show that \\(\\mathbb P(A) \\leq 1\\). We can do this using the third statement of this theorem. For any event \\(A \\subset \\Omega\\), the third statement tells us that \\(\\mathbb P(A) \\leq \\mathbb P(\\Omega)\\). But Axiom 2 tells us that \\(\\mathbb P(\\Omega) = 1\\), so we are done. 2.6 Addition rules for unions If we have two or more events, we’d like to work out the probability of their union; that is, the probability that at least one of them occurs. We already have an addition rule for disjoint unions. Theorem 2.2 Let \\(A, B \\subset \\Omega\\) be two disjoint events. Then \\[ \\mathbb P(A \\cup B) = \\mathbb P(A) + \\mathbb P(B) . \\] Proof. In Axiom 3, take the finite sequence \\(A_1 = A\\), \\(A_2 = B\\). But what about if \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are not disjoint? Then we have the following. Theorem 2.3 Let \\(A, B \\subset \\Omega\\) be two events. Then \\[ \\mathbb P(A \\cup B) = \\mathbb P(A) + \\mathbb P(B) - \\mathbb P(A \\cap B) . \\] You may have seen this result before. You’ve perhaps justified it by saying something like this: “We can add the two probabilities together, except now we’ve double-counted the overlap, so we have to take the probability of that away.” Maybe you drew a Venn diagram. That’s OK as a way to remember the result – but this is a proper university mathematics course, so we have to carefully prove it starting from just the axioms and nothing else. As always, the key is to find a way of writing \\(A \\cup B\\) as a disjoint union. (In general, \\(A \\cup B\\) can be a non-disjoint union that has an overlap.) Well, if we want \\(A \\cup B = A \\cup \\{\\text{something}\\}\\) to be a disjoint union, then the “something” will have to be the bit of \\(B\\) that’s not also in \\(A\\), which is \\(B \\cap A^\\mathsf{c}\\).   Proof. First note, following the discussion above, that we have \\[ A \\cup B = A \\cup (B \\cap A^\\mathsf{c}) , \\] where the union on the right is of the disjoint events \\(A\\) and \\(B \\cap A^\\mathsf{c}\\). Therefore we can use Axiom 3 to get \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathbb P(A \\cup B) = \\mathbb P(A) + \\mathbb P(B \\cap A^\\mathsf{c}) . \\tag{2.1} \\end{equation}\\] The left-hand side looks good, and the first term on the right-hand side looks good. To deal with the second term on the right-hand side, we need to write it down as part of a disjoint union again. Can we find another one? Yes! We can use \\(B \\cap A^\\mathsf{c}\\) together with \\(B \\cap A\\) to build the whole of \\(B\\). So have a disjoint union \\[ (B \\cap A^\\mathsf{c}) \\cup (B \\cap A) = B .\\] Since this union is disjoint, we can use Axiom 3 again, to get \\[ \\mathbb P(B \\cap A^\\mathsf{c}) + \\mathbb P(B \\cap A) = \\mathbb P(B) . \\] Rearranging this gives \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathbb P(B \\cap A^\\mathsf{c}) = \\mathbb P(B) - \\mathbb P(B \\cap A). \\tag{2.2} \\end{equation}\\] Finally, substituting (2.2) into (2.1) gives \\[ \\mathbb P(A \\cup B) = \\mathbb P(A) + \\mathbb P(B) - \\mathbb P(A \\cap B) , \\] as required. Example 2.8 Consider picking a card from a deck at random, with \\(\\mathbb P(A) = |A|/52\\). What’s the probability the card is a spade or an ace? It is possible to just to work this out directly. But let’s use our addition law for unions. We have \\(\\mathbb P(\\text{spade}) = \\frac{13}{52}\\) and \\(\\mathbb P(\\text{ace}) = \\frac{4}{52}\\). So we have \\[ \\mathbb P(\\text{spade or ace}) = \\tfrac{13}{52} + \\tfrac{4}{52} - \\mathbb P(\\text{spade and ace}) . \\] But \\(\\mathbb P(\\text{spade and ace})\\) is the probability of picking the ace of spades, which is \\(\\frac{1}{52}\\). Therefore \\[ \\mathbb P(\\text{spade or ace}) = \\tfrac{13}{52} + \\tfrac{4}{52} - \\tfrac{1}{52} = \\tfrac{16}{52} = \\tfrac{4}{13} . \\] Similar addition rules can be proven in the same way for unions of more events. For three events, we have \\[ \\mathbb P(A \\cup B \\cup C) = \\mathbb P(A) + \\mathbb P(B) + \\mathbb P(C) - \\mathbb P(A \\cap B) - \\mathbb P(A \\cap C) - \\mathbb P(B \\cap C) + \\mathbb P(A \\cap B \\cap C) . \\] Note that we add the probabilities of individual events, then subtract the probabilities of pairs, then add the probability of the triple. The inclusion–exclusion principle is the general rule: \\[\\begin{multline*} \\mathbb P(A_1 \\cup A_2 \\cup \\cdots \\cup A_n) = \\sum_i \\mathbb P(A_i) - \\sum_{i \\neq j} \\mathbb P(A_i \\cap A_j) \\\\ + \\sum_{i \\neq j \\neq k} \\mathbb P(A_i \\cap A_j \\cap A_k) - \\cdots + (-1)^{n-1} \\mathbb P(A_1 \\cap A_2 \\cap \\cdots \\cap A_n) , \\end{multline*}\\] where we continue by subtracting the probabilities of quadruples, adding the probabilities of five events, etc. Summary A sample space \\(\\Omega\\) is a set representing all possible sample outcomes. An event is a subset of \\(\\Omega\\). For events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), we also have the complement “not \\(A\\)” \\(A^\\mathsf{c}\\), the intersection “\\(A\\) and \\(B\\)” \\(A \\cap B\\), and the union “\\(A\\) or \\(B\\)” \\(A \\cup B\\). The axioms of probability are (1) \\(\\mathbb P(A) \\geq 0\\); (2) \\(\\mathbb P(\\Omega) = 1\\); and (3) that for disjoint events \\(A_1, A_2, \\dots\\), we have \\(\\mathbb P(A_1 \\cup A_2 \\cup \\cdots) = \\mathbb P(A_1) + \\mathbb P(A_2) + \\cdots\\). Other properties can be proven from these axioms, like the complement rule \\(\\mathbb P(A^\\mathsf{c}) = 1 - \\mathbb P(A)\\), and the addition rule for unions \\(\\mathbb P(A \\cup B) = \\mathbb P(A) + \\mathbb P(B) - \\mathbb P(A \\cap B)\\). "],["S03-classical.html", "Section 3 Classical probability 3.1 Probability with equally likely outcomes 3.2 Multiplication principle 3.3 Sampling with and without replacement 3.4 Ordering 3.5 Sampling without replacement in any order 3.6 Birthday problem Summary", " Section 3 Classical probability 3.1 Probability with equally likely outcomes Classical probability is the name we give to probability where there are a finite number of equally likely outcomes. Classical probability was the first type of probability to be formally studied – partly because it is the simplest, and partly because it was useful for working out how to win at gambling. Tossing fair coins, rolling dice, and dealing cards are all common gambling situations that can be studied using classical probability – in a deck of cards, for example, there are 52 cards that are equally likely to be drawn. Among the first works to seriously study classical probability were “Book on Games of Chance” by Girolamo Cardano (written in 1564, but not published until 1663, one hundred years later), and a famous series of letters letters between Blaise Pascal and Pierre de Fermat in 1654. Definition 3.1 Let \\(\\Omega\\) be a finite sample space. Then the classical probability measure on \\(\\Omega\\) is given by \\[ \\mathbb P(A) = \\frac{|A|}{|\\Omega|} . \\] So to work out a classical probability \\(\\mathbb P(A)\\), crucially we need to be able to count how many outcomes \\(|A|\\) are in the event \\(A\\) and count how many outcomes \\(|\\Omega|\\) are in the whole sample space \\(\\Omega\\). (This is why classical probability is also called “enumerative probability” – “enumeration” is another word for counting.) In this section, we’ll look at some different ways in which we can count the number of outcomes in common events and sample spaces. There’s something we ought to check before going any further! Theorem 3.1 Let \\(\\Omega\\) be a finite nonempty sample space. Then the classical probability measure on \\(\\Omega\\), \\[ \\mathbb P(A) = \\frac{|A|}{|\\Omega|} , \\] is indeed a probability measure, in that is satisfies the three axioms in Definition 2.2. Proof. We’ll take the axioms one by one. Since \\(|\\Omega| \\geq 1\\) and \\(|A| \\geq 0\\), it is indeed the case that \\(\\mathbb P(A) = |A|/|\\Omega| \\geq 0\\). We have \\({\\displaystyle \\mathbb P(\\Omega) = \\frac{|\\Omega|}{|\\Omega|} = 1}\\), as required. Since we have a finite sample space, we only need to show Axiom 3 for a sequence of two disjoint events; the argument can be repeated to get any finite number of events. Let \\(A = \\{a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_k\\}\\) and \\(B = \\{b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_l\\}\\) be two disjoint events with \\(|A| = k\\) and \\(|B| = l\\). Note that we can enumerate the elements of the disjoint union \\(C = A \\cup B\\) as \\[ c_1 = a_1, c_2 = a_2, \\dots, c_k = a_k, c_{k+1} = b_1, c_{k+2} = b_2, \\dots, c_{k+l} = b_l . \\] Since \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are disjoint, this list has no repeats, and we see that \\(|C| = |A \\cup B| = k+l\\). Hence \\[ \\mathbb P(A \\cup B) = \\frac{k+l}{|\\Omega|} = \\frac{k}{|\\Omega|} + \\frac{l}{|\\Omega|} = \\mathbb P(A) + \\mathbb P(B) , \\] and Axiom 3 is fulfilled. 3.2 Multiplication principle In classical probability, to find the probability of an event \\(A\\), we need to count the number of outcomes in \\(A\\) and the total number of possible outcomes in \\(\\Omega\\). This can be easy when we’re just looking at one choice – like the 2 outcomes from tossing a single coin, the 6 outcomes of rolling a single dice, or the 52 outcomes from dealing a single card. Now we’re going to look at what happens if there are a number of choices one after another – like tossing multiple coins, rolling more than one dice, or dealing a hand of cards. Here, an important principle is the multiplication principle. The multiplication principle says that if you have \\(n\\) choices followed by \\(m\\) choices, than all together you have \\(n \\times m\\) total choices. You can see this by imagining the choices in a \\(n \\times m\\) grid, with the \\(n\\) columns representing the first choice and \\(m\\) rows representing the second choice. For example, suppose you go to a burger restaurant where there are 3 choices of burger (beefburger, chicken burger, veggie burger) and 2 choices of sides (fries, salad), then altogether there are \\(3 \\times 2 = 6\\) choices of meal. Beefburger Chicken burger Veggie burger Fries 1: Beefburger with fries 2: Chicken burger with fries 3: Veggie burger with fries Salad 4: Beefburger with salad 5: Chicken burger with salad 6: Veggie burger with salad More generally, if you have \\(m\\) stages of choosing, with \\(n_1\\) choices in the first stage, then \\(n_2\\) choices in the second stage, all the way to \\(n_m\\) choices in the final stage, you have \\(n_1 \\times n_2 \\times \\cdots \\times n_m\\) total choices altogether. Example 3.1 Five fair coins are tossed. What is the probability they all show the same face? Here, the sample space \\(\\Omega\\) is the set of all sequences of 5 coin outcomes. How many sample outcomes are in \\(\\Omega\\)? Well, the first coin can be heads or tails (2 choices); the second coin can be heads or tails (2 choices) and so on, until the fifth and final coin. So, by the multiplication principle, \\(|\\Omega| = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2^5 = 32\\). The event we’re interested in is \\(A = \\{\\text{HHHHH}, \\text{TTTTT}\\}\\), the event that the faces are all the same – either all heads or all tails. This clearly has \\(|A| = 2\\) outcomes. So the probability all five coins show the same face is \\[ \\mathbb P(A) = \\frac{|A|}{|\\Omega|} = \\frac{2}{32} = \\frac{1}{16} \\approx 0.06. \\] Example 3.2 Five dice are rolled. What is the probability we get at least one 6? Here, \\(\\Omega\\) is the set of all possible sequences of 5 dice rolls. Clearly \\(|\\Omega| = 6^5 = 7776\\). Also, \\(A\\) is the set of all dice roll sequences with at least one 6. Whenever you see a question with the phrase “at least one” in it, it’s very often to look at the complementary event \\(A^\\mathsf{c}\\) instead. We know from the last section that \\(\\mathbb P(A) = 1 - \\mathbb P(A^\\mathsf{c})\\), but in “at least one” questions, it’s often easier to count \\(|A^\\mathsf{c}|\\) than to count \\(|A|\\). Here, is \\(A\\) is the set of all dice roll sequences with at least one 6, then \\(A^\\mathsf{c}\\) is the set of dice roll sequence with no 6 at all. This means all five dice must have rolled a 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. Since each of the five dice rolls has 5 possibilities, this means that \\(|A^\\mathsf{c}| = 5^5 = 3125\\). Finally, we see that \\[ \\mathbb P(A) = 1 - \\mathbb P(A^\\mathsf{c}) = 1 - \\frac{|A^\\mathsf{c}|}{|\\Omega|} = 1 - \\frac{5^5}{6^5} = \\frac{4651}{7776} \\approx 0.70 .\\] 3.3 Sampling with and without replacement Example 3.3 A bag contains 15 balls: 10 black balls and 5 white balls. We draw 3 balls out of the bag. What is the probability all 3 balls are black (a) if we put each ball back into the bag after it is chosen; (b) if we do not put each ball back into the bag after it is chosen. Let’s start with (a). The number of ways to choose a ball out 15 on three occasions is \\(|\\Omega| = 15^3\\). The number of ways to choose a black balls out of 10 on three occasions is \\(|A| = 10^3\\). Hence \\[ \\mathbb P(A) = \\frac{|A|}{|\\Omega|} = \\frac{10^3}{15^3} = \\frac{1000}{3375} = \\frac{8}{27} \\approx 0.30. \\] What about (b)? Here we don’t put the ball back in the bag once it has been chosen. There are 15 ways to pick the first ball. But then there are only 14 balls left in the bag for the second choice, and only 13 balls for the third choice. So \\(|\\Omega| = 15\\times14\\times13\\). Similarly, there are 10 ways the first ball can be black. But once that black ball is removed, only 9 choices for the second black ball, and only 8 for the third. So \\(|A| = 10\\times9\\times8\\). So this time we have \\[ \\mathbb P(A) = \\frac{|A|}{|\\Omega|} = \\frac{10\\times9\\times8}{15\\times14\\times13} = \\frac{720}{2730} = \\frac{24}{91} \\approx 0.26, \\] which is smaller than the answer in part (a). This example illustrated the difference between sampling with replacement (when the balls were put back into the bag) and sampling without replacement (when the balls were not put back). If we want to sample \\(k\\) items from a set of \\(n\\) items, then: the number of ways to sample with replacement is \\[ n^k = n\\times n\\times\\cdots\\times n; \\] the number of ways to sample without replacement is \\[ {n}^{\\underline{k}} = n\\times(n-1)\\times \\cdots\\times (n-k+1) .\\] Here, we’ve defined the notation \\({n}^{\\underline{k}}\\) for the number of ways to sample without replacement; this is called the falling factorial or permutation number. (Notice that the subscript is underlined here; other notations include \\((n)_k\\), \\(P(n,k)\\), or \\({}^nP_k\\).) 3.4 Ordering Example 3.4 Suppose a lecturer marks a pile of \\(n\\) exam papers, all of which receive a different mark. What is the probability she ends up marking them in order from lowest scoring first in the pile to highest scoring last in the pile? Here, the sample space \\(\\Omega\\) is the set of all orderings of the \\(n\\) exam papers by mark, and \\(A\\) is the event that the papers are in order from lowest to highest scoring. It’s clear that \\(|A| = 1\\): since the exams scored different marks, there’s only one way of putting the exams in the correct lowest-to-highest order. But what’s \\(|\\Omega|\\)? There are \\(n\\) choices for the first exam paper to be marked. Then, for the second exam paper, there are \\(n - 1\\) choices left, because I’m not going to mark the same paper twice. There are \\(n-2\\) choices for the third exam paper. And so on, until I have marked \\(n-1\\) papers, and there is only 1 choice left for the final paper. So we have \\[ |\\Omega| = {n}^{\\underline{n}} = n(n-1)(n-2)\\cdots3\\cdot2\\cdot1 = n! \\] ways to order the exam papers. Hence, the probability the papers are marked in order is \\[ \\mathbb P(A) = \\frac{|A|}{|\\Omega|} = \\frac{1}{n(n-1)\\cdots2\\cdot1} = \\frac{1}{n!} . \\] This number \\[ n! = {n}^{\\underline{n}} = n(n-1)(n-2)\\cdots3\\cdot2\\cdot1 \\] is called \\(n\\) factorial and denoted \\(n!\\). It is the number of ways that \\(n\\) different objects can be ordered. It can sometimes be useful to write the falling factorial \\({n}^{\\underline{k}}\\) in terms of the factorial, like this: \\[\\begin{align*} {n}^{\\underline{k}} &amp;= n(n-1)\\cdots(n-k+1) \\\\ &amp;= n(n-1)\\cdots(n-k+1)\\times\\frac{(n-k)(n-k-1)\\cdots2\\cdot1}{(n-k)(n-k-1)\\cdots2\\cdot1} \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{n(n-1)\\cdots(n-k+1)(n-k)(n-k-1)\\cdots2\\cdot1}{(n-k)(n-k-1)\\cdots2\\cdot1} \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}. \\end{align*}\\] Example 3.5 Suppose you shuffle a pack of cards. The resulting ordering of the deck has \\(52!\\) possibilities. This is an unimaginably huge number – it’s roughly \\[ 52! \\approx 8 \\times 10^{67} ; \\] that is, an 8 followed by 67 zeroes. In comparison, the universe has existed for about \\(4 \\times 10^{17}\\) seconds, and there are about \\(7 \\times 10^{9}\\) people alive. If every person on the planet had shuffled a deck of cards one million times a second for the entire lifetime of the universe, they could only expect to have got through \\[ (4 \\times 10^{17}) \\times (7 \\times 10^{9}) \\times 10^6 \\approx 3 \\times 10^{33} .\\] This is only the most tiny, microscopic fraction of \\(52!\\). So every time you have ever shuffled a deck of cards, it is essentially certain that you have created an ordering of the deck that has never existed before. 3.5 Sampling without replacement in any order Example 3.6 In “Lotto”, the UK national lottery, you can buy a ticket for £2 and choose 6 numbers between 1 and 59. If your 6 numbers the 6 numbers chosen by the lottery machine, you win the jackpot (usually between £2 million and £20 million, shared between the tickets that get all 6 numbers). If you buy a ticket, what is the probability you win the jackpot? Here, \\(\\Omega\\) is the set of all possible sets of 6 winning numbers, and \\(A\\) is the set of numbers on your ticket. Clearly \\(|A| = 1\\), but what is \\(|\\Omega|\\)? Well, the first number out of the machine has 59 possibilities, the second number has 58 possibilities, and so on, making \\[ 59 \\times 58 \\times 57 \\times 56 \\times 55 \\times 54 = {59}^{\\underline{6}} . \\] But this isn’t the correct answer, because the same set of numbers could be drawn from the machine in any order! The sets of numbers \\(\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}\\) and \\(\\{1,2,3,4,6,5\\}\\) and \\(\\{6,5,4,3,2,1\\}\\) are all the same set of numbers. How many ways can we see the same list of numbers? This is precisely the number of orderings of 6 numbers, which we know is \\(6!\\). So the number of possible sets of 6 numbers to come out of the machine is actually \\[ \\binom{59}{6} = \\frac{{59}^{\\underline{6}}}{6!} = \\frac{59 \\times 58 \\times 57 \\times 56 \\times 55 \\times 54}{6\\times5\\times4\\times3\\times2\\times1} \\approx 45 \\text{ million} . \\] Thus the probability that your ticket wins the jackpot is \\[ \\mathbb P(A) = \\frac{|A|}{|\\Omega|} = \\frac{1}{\\binom{59}{6}} \\approx \\frac{1}{45 \\text{ million}} \\approx 0.00000002 . \\] Here, we have introduced the notation \\[ \\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{{n}^{\\underline{k}}}{k!} = \\frac{n(n-1) \\cdots (n-k+1)}{k(k-1)\\cdots2\\cdot1} \\] for the number of ways to choose \\(k\\) objects out of \\(n\\) with replacement but where the order they were chosen in doesn’t matter. This is called the binomial coefficient, although when we say it out loud we normally just say “\\(n\\) choose \\(k\\)”. (Another notation for the binomial coefficient is \\({}^n C_k\\).) It can sometimes be useful to remember that \\({n}^{\\underline{k}} = n!/(n-k)!\\) allows us to write the binomial coefficient in terms of the factorial function as \\[ \\binom nk = \\frac{{n}^{\\underline{k}}}{(n-k)!} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} . \\] Example 3.7 You are dealt a “hand” of 13 cards from a deck of 52 cards. What is the probability that you have the Ace, King, Queen, and Jack of Spades? Here, \\(\\Omega\\) is the set of all 13-card hands from the deck, and \\(A\\) is the subset of those that contain the AKQJ of Spades. Using the binomial coefficient notation, it’s clear that \\[ |\\Omega| = \\binom{52}{13} = \\frac{52\\times51\\times\\cdots\\times41\\times40}{13\\times12\\times\\cdots\\times2\\times1} . \\] What about \\(|A|\\)? If we fix the fact that the hand contains the 4 cards AKQJ of Spades, then it also contains \\(13-4=9\\) cards out of the other \\(52-4 = 48\\) remaining cards in the deck. This makes \\[ |A| = \\binom{48}{9} = \\frac{48\\times47\\times\\cdots\\times41\\times40}{9\\times8\\times\\cdots\\times2\\times1}\\] hands. Thus the probability that the hand contains AKQJ of Spades is \\[ \\mathbb P(A) = \\frac{|A|}{|\\Omega|} = \\frac{\\binom{48}{9}}{\\binom{52}{13}} . \\] Conveniently, we can simplify the expression quite a lot, because plenty of cancellation will go on. We have \\[\\begin{align*} \\mathbb P(A) = \\frac{\\binom{48}{9}}{\\binom{52}{13}} &amp;= \\frac{\\frac{48\\times47\\times\\cdots\\times41\\times40}{9\\times8\\times\\cdots\\times2\\times1}}{\\frac{52\\times51\\times\\cdots\\times41\\times40}{13\\times12\\times\\cdots\\times2\\times1}} \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{48\\times47\\times\\cdots\\times41\\times40}{52\\times51\\times\\cdots\\times41\\times40} \\times \\frac{13\\times12\\times\\cdots\\times2\\times1}{9\\times8\\times\\cdots\\times2\\times1} \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{13\\times12\\times11\\times10}{52\\times51\\times50\\times49} \\\\ &amp;\\approx 0.0026 , \\end{align*}\\] or about 1 in every 380 hands. There’s one other useful fact about the binomial coefficient we should mention. Theorem 3.2 \\[ \\binom nk = \\binom{n}{n-k}. \\] We’ll give two different proofs of this fact. Proof. We can use the formula for the binomial coefficient in terms of the factorial function. This formula gives \\[ \\binom nk = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \\qquad \\binom{n}{n-k} = \\frac{n!}{(n-k)!k!} . \\] It’s clear from the factorial expression that these two quantities are equal. Proof. Suppose we have \\(n\\) balls, and we want to paint \\(k\\) of the red and the other \\(n-k\\) blue. How many ways can we do this? One way is to say there are \\(\\binom nk\\) ways to choose the \\(k\\) balls to paint red, then we are forced paint the other \\(n - k\\) blue. Another way is to say there are \\(\\binom{n}{n-k}\\) to choose the \\(n-k\\) balls to paint blue, then we are forced to paint the other \\(k\\) red. We have “double counted” the same quantity two different ways, so the answer must be the same, so \\[ \\binom nk = \\binom{n}{n-k}. \\] Which proof do you prefer? (I strongly prefer the second proof, because I think it doesn’t just verify that the theorem is true, but further explains why the result is true.) 3.6 Birthday problem There are \\(k = 23\\) students in a class. What is the probability that at least two of the students share a birthday? This a famous problem, known as the “birthday problem”. You may have seen this problem before. But let’s try to solve it using the techniques from this section of notes. (We’ll assume all days are equally likely for birthdays, and ignore the effect of leap days.) The sample space \\(|\\Omega|\\) is the set of possible birthdays for the \\(k\\) students. Clearly \\(|\\Omega| = 365^k\\). Let \\(A\\) be the even that at least two students share a birthday. Since this is an “at least” event, it seems like it might be a good idea to look instead at the complement event \\(A^\\mathsf{c}\\) instead. If \\(A\\) is the event that there’s at least one shared birthday, then \\(A^\\mathsf{c}\\) is the event that there are no shared birthdays; that is, \\(A^\\mathsf{c}\\) is the event that all \\(k\\) students have different birthdays. So what is \\(|A^\\mathsf{c}|\\), the number of ways the \\(k\\) students can have different birthdays? Well, the first student can have any of the 365 days for their birthday. For them to have different birthdays, the second student only has 364 days available. Then the third student must avoid the birthday of students 1 and 2, so has 363 available days, and so on. We see that \\[ |A^\\mathsf{c}| = 365 \\times 364 \\times \\cdots \\times (365 - k + 1) = 365^{\\underline{k}} . \\] Hence, the probability at least two students share a birthday is \\[ \\mathbb P(A) = 1 - \\mathbb P(A^\\mathsf{c}) = 1 - \\frac{365^{\\underline{k}}}{365^k} = 1 - \\frac{365}{365} \\cdot \\frac{364}{365} \\cdots \\frac{365-k+1}{365} . \\] Setting \\(k = 23\\), we can calculate the required answer in R: k &lt;- 23 1 - prod((365:(365 - k + 1)) / 365) ## [1] 0.5072972 The probability is 50.7%. So it’s more likely than not that at least two students share a birthday. Some people find it surprising that only 23 students have such a high probability of sharing a birthday, since 23 is so small compared to 365. But remember there are \\(\\binom{23}{2} = 253\\) pairs of birthdays, each of which is a potential match, and 253 is quite a big number. Summary “Classical probability” describes the situation where there are finitely many equally likely outcomes. The classical probability \\(\\mathbb P(A) = |A|/|\\Omega|\\) requires us to count how many outcomes there are in events or sample spaces. The multiplication principle says that \\(n\\) choices followed by \\(m\\) choices makes \\(n \\times m\\) choices in total. Sampling \\(k\\) objects out of \\(n\\) with replacement gives \\(n^k\\) choices. Sampling \\(k\\) objects out of \\(n\\) without replacement gives \\(n^{\\underline{k}} = n(n-1)\\dots(n-k+1)\\) choices. Ordering \\(n\\) objects can be done in \\(n! = n^{\\underline{n}} = n(n-1)\\dots2\\cdot1\\) ways. The number of ways to sample \\(k\\) objects out of \\(n\\) when the order doesn’t matter is given by the binomial coefficient \\(\\binom nk = {n}^{\\underline{k}}/k!\\). "],["P2.html", "Problem Sheet 2 A: Short questions B: Long questions C: Assessed questions Solutions to short questions", " Problem Sheet 2 .myanswers { display: none !important; } This is Problem Sheet 2.

These two questions count for 3% of your final mark for this module. The deadline for submitting your solutions is 2pm on Monday 25 October at the beginning of Week 5, although I strongly recommend completing and submitting your work during Week 4. Submission will be via Gradescope; submission will open on Monday 18 October. Your work will be marked by your tutor and returned on Monday 1 November, when solutions will also be made available. Both questions are “long questions”, where the marks are not only for mathematical accuracy but also for the clarity and completeness of your explanations. You should not collaborate with others on the assessed questions: your answers must represent solely your own work. The University’s rules on academic integrity – and the related punishments for violating them – apply to your work on the assessed questions. C1. Let \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) be two events with \\(\\mathbb P(A) = 0.8\\) and \\(\\mathbb P(B) = 0.4\\). The following questions concern the value of \\(\\mathbb P(A \\cap B)\\), the probability that both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) occur. (a) Prove the upper bound \\(\\mathbb P(A \\cap B) \\leq 0.4\\). (b) Prove that this upper bound can be achieved, by giving an example of a sample space \\(\\Omega\\), a probability measure \\(\\mathbb P\\) and events \\(A, B \\subset \\Omega\\) such that \\(\\mathbb P(A) = 0.8\\) and \\(\\mathbb P(B) = 0.4\\), with equality \\(\\mathbb P(A \\cap B) = 0.4\\) in the upper bound. (c) Give a lower bound for \\(\\mathbb P(A \\cap B)\\) – that is, prove that \\(\\mathbb P(A \\cap B) \\geq \\text{something}\\) – and show that this lower bound can be achieved. (Try to work out the correct bound, even if you can’t formally prove it.) C2. A “random digit” is a number chosen at random from \\(\\{0, 1, \\dots, 9\\}\\), each with equal probability.

R is very widely used in universities and increasingly widely used in industry. Learning to use R is a mandatory part of this module, and exercises requiring use of R make up at least 15% of your module mark. Many other statistics-related course at the University also use R. RStudio is a program that gives a convenient way to work with the language R. RStudio is the most common way to use the language R, and learning to use RStudio is strongly recommended. R and RStudio are free/open-source software. How to access R and RStudio There are a number of ways you can access R and RStudio: All University computers have R and RStudio already installed. Here is a directory of the University’s computer clusters. You can install R and RStudio on your own computer – see the instructions below. If you want to use R/RStudio on a non-University device for which you don’t have admin/installation rights (Chromebook, iPad, friend’s laptop, etc), you could try: You can use the University’s copies of R/RStudio virtually through the Windows Virtual Desktop or AppsAnywhere client. The RStudio Cloud is a cloud-hosted “Google Docs for R” that you can use through your web browser – you can get 25 hours per month for free (or pay for more). Installing R and RStudio Students who have their own computer usually find it most convenient to install R and RStudio on that computer. To do this, it’s important that you install R (the programming language) first, and only install RStudio (the program to use R) once R has already been installed. First, install R. Go to the Comprehensive R Archive Network and follow the instructions: Windows: Click “Download R for Windows”, then “Install R for the first time”. The main link at the top should be to download the most recent version of R. Mac: Click Download R for macOS, and then download the relevant PKG file. (For pre-November 2020 Intel-based Macbooks, you must use the “Intel 64-bit build”; for post-November 2020 M1-based “Apple silicon” Macbooks, the “Apple silicon arm64 build” may be faster.) After R is installed, then install RStudio. Go to the Download page at RStudio.com and follow the instructions. You want “RStudio Desktop”, and you want the free version. If you have difficulty installing R, come along to the first computational drop-in session in Week 2 and bring your computer with you (if it’s sufficiently portable), and we’ll do our best to help. Troubleshooting drop-in sessions You will learn to use R by working through the R Worksheets. Learning to use a programming language is different from learning mathematics: you should expect to regularly get frustrated and annoyed when the computer seems to refuse to do what you want it to (but also occasionally experience the joy of getting it right!). This is a normal part of learning. However, many students find getting with started with R in the first few weeks particularly frustrating. Also, sometimes students have problems installing R and RStudio on their own computers. To help with this, we have organised optional troubleshooting drop-in sessions in Weeks 2 and 3. Check your timetable for details – they are probably listed as “computer practicals”. "],["solutions.html", "Solutions and group feedback Problem Sheet 1", " Solutions and group feedback There are many ways you get feedback on this module, both group feedback (feedback that is generally relevant to many people) and individual feedback (feedback based specifically on your own approach to the work). You will have received both individual and group spoken feedback in your tutorial (the more you speak up in your tutorial, the more individualised the feedback you get in return). These solutions include group written feedback on common issues for the class. Most importantly, when your work on assessed questions is marked, individual written feedback will be given via the Gradescope site. It is very important that you read that feedback. Finally, students who would like even more feedback can discuss their work in the “office hours” drop-in sessions. Problem Sheet 1 A1. Consider again the “number of Skittles in each packet” data from Example 1.1. \\[ 59, \\ 59, \\ 59, \\ 59, \\ 60, \\ 60, \\ 60, \\ 61, \\ 62, \\ 62, \\ 62, \\ 63, \\ 63 .\\] (a) Calculate the mean number of Skittles in each packet. Solution. This was in the notes: \\[ \\bar x = \\frac{1}{13} (59 + 59 + \\cdots + 63) = \\frac{789}{13} = 60.7 .\\] (b) Calculate the sample variance using the computational formula. Solution. \\[\\begin{align*} s_x^2 &amp;= \\frac{1}{13 - 1} \\left( (59^2 + 59^2 + \\cdots + 63^2) - 13 \\times 60.6923^2)\\right) \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{1}{12} (47915 - 47886.2) \\\\ &amp;= 2.40 \\end{align*}\\] Group feedback: With the computational formula, the value \\(\\sum_i x_i^2 - n \\bar{x}^2\\) is typically a fairly small number given as the difference between two very big numbers \\(\\sum_i x_i^2\\) and \\(n \\bar x^2\\). This means you have to get the two big numbers very precise, to ensure the cancellation happens correctly; in particular, make sure you use plenty of decimal places of accuracy in \\(\\bar x\\). (c) Calculate the sample variance using the definitional formula. Solution. \\[\\begin{align*} s_x^2 &amp;= \\frac{1}{13 - 1} \\left( (59 - 60.7)^2 + (59 - 60.7)^2 + \\cdots + (63 - 60.7)^2 \\right) \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{1}{12} (2.86 + 2.86 + \\cdots + 5.33) \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{1}{12} \\times 28.77 \\\\ &amp;= 2.40 \\end{align*}\\] (d) Out of (b) and (c), which calculation did you find easier, and why? Solution. The computational formula required fewer presses of the calculator buttons, because \\(\\sum_i x_i^2\\) is fewer button-presses than \\(\\sum_i (x_i - \\bar x)^2\\), where you have to subtract the means before squaring. On the other hand, the expression inside the brackets of the computational formula is a fairly small number given as the difference of two very large numbers, so it was necessary to use lots of decimal places of accuracy in \\(\\bar x\\) to make sure the second large number was accurate and therefore that the subtraction cancelled correctly. A2. Consider the following data sets of the age of elected politicians on a local council. (The “18–30” consists of people older than and including 18, and younger than but not including 30.) Age (years) Frequency Relative frequency Frequency density 18–30 1 30–40 3 40–45 4 45–50 5 50–55 3 55–60 1 60–70 3 Total 20 1 — (a) Complete the table by filling in the relative frequency and frequency densities. Solution. Age (years) Frequency Relative frequency Frequency density 18–30 1 0.05 0.0041 30–40 3 0.15 0.015 40–45 4 0.2 0.04 45–50 5 0.25 0.05 50–55 3 0.15 0.03 55–60 1 0.05 0.01 60–70 3 0.15 0.015 Total 20 1 — (b) What is the median age bin? Solution. The 10th- and 11th-largest observations are both in the 45–50 bin, which is therefore the median bin. (c) Calculate (an approximation of) the mean age of the politicians. Solution. Pretending that each person is in the centre of their bin, we have \\[ \\bar x = \\frac{1}{20} (1\\times24 + 3\\times 35 + \\cdots + 3 \\times 65) = \\frac{946.5}{20} = 47.3 . \\] B1. For each of the two datasets below, calculate the following summary statistics, or explain why it is not possible to do so: mode; median; mean; number of distinct outcomes; inter-quartile range; and sample variance. (a) Six packets of Skittles are opened together, and the total number of sweets of each colour is: Colour Red Orange Yellow Green Purple Number of Skittles 67 71 87 74 62 Solution. The modal colour is Yellow. The number of distinct outcomes is 5. It’s not possible to calculate the median or the quartiles, because, unlike numerical data, the colours can’t be put “in order” from smallest to largest. It’s not possible to calculate the mean or sample variance, as these require us to have numerical data that can be “added up”, but this can’t be done with colours. (b) Shirt sizes for a university football squad: Colour Xtra Small Small Medium Large Xtra Large Number of shirts 0 1 6 4 5 [Note: This has been corrected from an earlier version, where the 4 Large and 5 Xtra Large were the wrong way round.] Solution. The modal shirt size is medium. The number of distinct outcomes is 4 (we don’t quite “Xtra Small”, which was not observed in the data). This time, we can order the data from smallest to largest, even though the data is not numerical. Since \\((16 + 1)/2 - 8.5\\), the median datapoint is the 8th or 9th datapoints, which are Large. Since \\(1 + 0.25(16 - 1) = 4.75\\) the lower quartile is the 4th or 5th datapoints, which are Medium. Since \\(1 + 0.75(16-1) = 12.25\\), the upper quartile is the 12th or 13th datapoints, which are Xtra Large. So we can certainly say that the inner quartiles range from Medium to Xtra Large. We could probably also say that the interquartile range is 3 shirt sizes (Medium, Large, Xtra Large). Again, because the data is not numerical, we can’t add it up, so can’t calculate a mean or sample variance. Group feedback: Make sure your explanation is clear for why we can’t calculate a median for the Skittles data but can for the shirts: they key is whether or not the data can be ordered. B2. A summary statistic is informally said to be “robust” if it typically doesn’t change much if a small number of outliers are introduced to a large dataset, or “sensitive” if it often changes a lot when a small number of outliers are introduced. Briefly discuss the robustness or sensitivity of the following summary statistics: (a) mode; (b) median; (c) mean; (d) number of distinct outcomes; (e) inter-quartile range; and (f) sample variance. Solutions. (a) The mode will typically not change at all if a small number of outliers are introduced, so is robust. (The exception is for data where every observation is likely to be different, so the outliers become “joint modes” along with everything else; but in this case the mode is not a useful statistic in the first place.) (b) The introduction of outliers will typically only change the median a little bit, by shifting it between different nearby values in the “central mass” of the data. In particular, the size of the outliers won’t make any difference at all (only whether they are “high outliers” or “low outliers”). So the median is robust. (c) The mean can change a lot is outliers are introduced. (Think about the mean net worth of people in you tutorial group, and how it would change if Jeff Bezos or Elon Musk joined your tutorial group.) So the mean is sensitive. (d) The number of distinct outcomes will only increase by (at most) 1 for each outlier introduced, so is robust. (e) The interquartile range is robust, for the same reason as the median. (f) The sample variance is sensitive, for the same reason as the mean. (You might like to think about situations where it’s better to use a robust statistic or better to use a sensitive statistic.) Group feedback: Remember that “robust” and “sensitive” are general descriptions rather than precise mathematical definitions. So it doesn’t matter if you disagree with my opinions provided that you give clear and detailed explanations to back up your opinion. B3. Let \\(\\mathbf a = (a_1, a_2, \\dots a_n)\\) and \\(\\mathbf b = (b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_n)\\) be two real-valued vectors of the same length. Then the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality says that \\[ \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i b_i \\right)^2 \\leq \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2 \\right) \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n b_i^2 \\right) . \\] Use the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality to show that the correlation \\(r_{xy}\\) satisfies \\(-1 \\leq r_{xy} \\leq 1\\). (Hint: Try to prove that \\(s_{xy}^2 \\leq s_x^2 s_y^2\\). How does this help?) Solutions. The first thing we want do is get from the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality \\[ \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i b_i \\right)^2 \\leq \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2 \\right) \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n b_i^2 \\right) . \\] to the hint \\(s_{xy}^2 \\leq s_x^2 s_y^2\\). We’ll do this by making a clever choice for \\((a_i)\\) and \\((b_i)\\) in Cauchy–Schwarz that tells us something useful about \\(s_{xy}\\), \\(s_x^2\\), and \\(s_y^2\\). Recalling the formulas for \\(s_{xy}\\), \\(s_x^2\\), and \\(s_y^2\\), \\[\\begin{align*} s_{xy} &amp;= \\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar x)(y_i - \\bar y) ,\\\\ s_{x}^2 &amp;= \\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar x)^2 ,\\\\ s_{y}^2 &amp;= \\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\bar y)^2 , \\end{align*}\\] and comparing them with the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality, it looks like taking \\(a_i = x_i - \\bar x\\) and \\(b_i = y_i - \\bar y\\) might be useful. Making the substitution, we get \\[ \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar x)(y_i - \\bar y) \\right)^2 \\leq \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar x)^2 \\right) \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\bar y)^2 \\right) . \\] These are very close to the formulas for \\(s_{xy}\\), \\(s_x^2\\), and \\(s_y^2\\), but are just missing the “\\(1/(n-1)\\)”s; what we in fact have is \\[ \\left( (n-1) s_{xy} \\right)^2 \\leq (n-1)s_x^2 \\cdot (n-1) s_y^2 .\\] Cancelling \\((n-1)^2\\) from each side, we have \\(s_{xy}^2 \\leq s_x^2 s_y^2\\), and we’ve proved the hint. We now want to get from the hint to the desired statement \\(-1 \\leq r_{xy} \\leq 1\\). Recall the formula for the correlation is \\[ r_{xy} = \\frac{s_{xy}}{s_xs_y} . \\] We can make the hint look a bit like this dividing both sides by \\(s_x^2 s_y^2\\), to get \\[\\frac{s_{xy}^2}{s_x^2 s_y^2} \\leq 1. \\] In fact that’s the square of the correlation on the left-hand side, so we’ve shown that \\(r_{xy}^2 \\leq 1\\). Finally, we note that if a number squared is less than or equal to 1, then the number must be between -1 and +1 inclusive. (Numbers bigger than 1 get bigger still when squared; number smalles than -1 become bigger than +1 when squared.) Hence we have shown that \\(-1 \\leq r_{xy} \\leq 1\\), as required. Group feedback: There are two halves to this question: first get from the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality to the hint, and second get from the hint to the answer \\(-1 \\leq r_{xy} \\leq 1\\). Many students struggled with the first half – but you can still try to do the second half. Especially in an exam, look for places where you can get marks for doing part of the question – and it doesn’t need to be the first part! B4. A researcher wishes to study the effect of mental health on academic achievement. The researcher will collect data on the mental health of a cohort of students by asking them to fill in a questionnaire, and will measure academic achievement via the students’ scores on their university exams. Discuss some of the ethical issues associated with the collection, storage, and analysis of this data, and with the publication of the results of the analysis. Are there ways to mitigate these issues? (It’s not necessary to write an essay for this question – a few short bulletpoints will suffice. There may be an opportunity to discuss these issues in more detail in your tutorial.) Group feedback: There are no “correct” or “incorrect” answers here, but here are a few things that students in my own tutorials brought up, which may act as a prompt for your own discussions. It’s important the students/subjects have given their consent for their data to be used this way. It must be “informed consent”, where they understand for what purpose the data will be used, how it will be stored, and so on. It must be possible and painless for students to decline to take part. Consideration should be given on how to anonymise the data as much as possible – it’s not necessary for those analysing the data to know which questionnaire or which exam result belongs to which student, only that the questionnaire and results can be paired up. Even if after data is anonymised, care should be taken about whether the students could be worked out from the data. For example, if only one student did a certain combination of modules, their identity could “leak” that way. Perhaps imprecise data, such as classes rather than exact marks, might help while only slightly reducing the usefulness of the data? On one hand, it seems like this data should perhaps be deleted once analysis has been carried out, for the privacy of the students. On the other hand, principles of “open science” suggest that the data should be kept – and even publically made available – for other researchers to check the work. There are competing ethical considerations here. If correlations are found in the data, care should be taken when publishing the analysis not to wrongly suggest a causation. (Just because X and Y are positively correlated, it doesn’t mean that X causes Y – or that Y causes X.) You can probably think of many other things.
