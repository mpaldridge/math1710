# About the exam

## Exam arrangements

* Check your exam timetable for the date and time of the exam.
  * For most people (without unusual clashes or special arrangements), the exam will happen on **Monday 15 January at 1400**.
* The exam will happen in person on campus.
  * Location to be announced at the end of this week.
* The exam will last for 2 hours (except for some students with special arrangements).

## Exam arrangements (2)

* You are allowed to use a basic non-programmable calculator for the exam.
  * More later...
* The exam will be **"closed-book"** style: you are not permitted to bring notes into the exam hall.
* A page of [statistical tables for the normal distribution](https://mpaldridge.github.io/math1710/stat-tab.pdf) will be on the final page of the exam paper.
* There will not be a formula book.

# Structure of the Exam

## Exam structure

The exam will be in three sections:

* **Section A:** 10 short multiple-choice questions (25% of marks)
* **Section B:** 10 short questions (25% of marks)
* **Section C:** 2 multi-part long questions (50% of marks)

## Section A

* 10 multiple-choice questions
* 2 marks each
* Total of 20 marks

These each require a single letter answer. No rough work will be read or marked.

You will enter these letter answers on a multiple-choice "bubble sheet".

*Recommended time: 3 minutes per question; 30 minutes total*

## Section B {.smaller}

* 10 single-part "short answer" questions
* 2 marks each
* Total of 20 marks

These require a clear answer and brief working or explanation.

* A correct answer with some working will get 2 marks
* Partial progress (or a correct answer with totally inadequate working) will get 1 mark.

You will answer these in an answer booklet.

*Recommended time: 3 minutes per question; 30 minutes total*

## Section C

* 2 multi-part "long answer" questions
* 20 marks each
* Total of 40 marks

Parts of these questions require full detailed answers, as in assessed work from problem sheets, and will have marks set aside for quality of explanations.

You will answer these in the same answer booklet as Section B.

*Recommended time: 30 minutes per question; 1 hour total.*

# Past papers

## Past papers

School of Maths policy is that for Level 1 modules, the three most recent past papers (with the same format) are available.

* The **2022--23** paper (from January 2023)
* The **2021--22** paper (from January 2022)
* *Not the 2020--21 paper, as this was held in pandemic times, and had a different format.*
* The **2019--20** paper (from January 2020)

These are all available from Minerva.

## Checksheets

* University policy is that we are not permitted to give out complete worked solutions to past exam papers.

* Instead, I have provided a "checksheet" for the three past papers 2021-22, 2019--20 and 2018--19.
  * This should give enough information for you to check your own answers, if you use the papers for your revision, but is rather bare-bones and doesn't give a lot of detail.

* I am happy to discuss exam questions in detail at office hours

## Checksheets (2)

I strongly recommend using all these past papers as part of your revision, and resisting the temptation to peek at the checksheet before trying the questions yourself, perhaps multiple times.

You may wish to test yourself by trying one of the papers sight-unseen under exam-like conditions.

## Notes on past papers

Some notes on the past papers:

* **2021-22 paper:**
  * Written by me, reflecting the module as taught this year
  * Excellent revision paper!
* **2021-22 paper:**
  * Written by me, reflecting the module as taught this year
  * A bit too hard! You should be able to score about 10% higher on your exam than this paper
  
## Notes on past papers (2)

* 2019--20 paper:
  * Not written by me, reflecting the module as someone else taught it
  * The material is almost identical, but some notation is different:
    * Eg. $\Pr(A)$ and $\mathrm{E}[X]$; not $\mathbb P(A)$ and $\mathbb EX$
  * You are not expected to be able to answer Question B9 (numerical integration in R)
  * In Question A8, all the multi-choice options are wrong!


# Exam FAQs

## Questions

**Q.** *I have a question about the exam. Who should I ask?*

For questions about **the mathematical content of the MATH1710 exam**, you should ask me.

For questions about the **organisation and administration of exams**, start with the SIS:

* <studentinfo@leeds.ac.uk>
* in person (Beech Grove House, Chem & Proc Eng, Maurice Keyworth, Parkinson, Worsley)

For **welfare** issues, contact your personal tutor.

## Calculators

**Q.** *Can I use a calculator in the exam?*

Yes! You may use a *basic, non-programmable* calculator in the MATH1710 exam.

## Calculators (2) {.smaller}

*"**Note that Calculators are only allowed in certain exams.** The module leader will be able to tell you whether a calculator can be used on the exam for their module. *

*"Where calculators can be used in MATH coded exams:*

* *Any basic (i.e., non-programmable) calculator is allowed.*
* *Calculators that can solve calculus problems or do matrix calculations are allowed if they are non-programmable. Examples of commonly used calculators that are allowed include the Casio FX-85 series and the Casio FX991 series.*
* *If you are not sure whether your calculator is non-programmable then check the manufacturer's website. Any calculator that is marketed as 'programmable' or 'graphic' is unlikely to be allowed in an exam. *

*"**Please note:** the school does not provide a definitive list of approved and non-approved calculators. The school do not verify / pre-approve calculators (some other schools may provide verification stickers but these are not needed for MATH exams). The exam invigilators will check calculators during the examination."*

## Revision

**Q.** *What tips do you have for revising for a University maths exam?*

---

![](revise.png)

## R questions on the exam

**Q.** *Can there be R questions on the exam?*

Yes!

. . .

* *"What would the output from R be if you entered the code..."*
* *"Write down some R code that would calculate..."*

Your exam has one multi-choice and one short question on R, totalling 4 marks (5% of the exam).

## R question: example 1

**A1.** What would the output from the following R code be?

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
data <- 1:10
round(sd(data), digits = 2)
```

**A:** 3.03  
**B:** 5.5  
**C:** 6.36  
**D:** 9.17  
**E** 40.5

. . .

**Answer.** This is asking for the standard deviation of $(1,2,3,...,9,10)$, which is **A:** 3.03.

## R question: example 2

**B4.** In RStudio, a vector `x` contains the values in the range of a discrete random variable $X$ and a vector `p` contains the corresponding probabilities. Write down an R command to evaluate $\mathbb EX(X-1)$ from `x` and `p`.

. . .

By the law of the unconscious statistician, this is calculated by
$$ \mathbb EX(X-1) = \sum_x x(x-1)\,p(x) . $$

This can be calculated with the R code
```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
sum(x * (x - 1) * p)
```

## Passing

**Q.** *What is the pass mark for this module?*

* Your coursework (Problem Sheets and R Worksheets) will be converted to a mark out of 100.
* Your exam mark will be converted to a mark out of 100.

$$ \text{Final} = 0.70 \times \text{Exam} + 0.30 \times \text{CW} $$

* You must have a final mark of at least 40 *and an exam mark of at least 40* to pass the module.

## Passing (2)

$$ \text{Final} = 0.70 \times \text{Exam} + 0.30 \times \text{CW} $$

* If $\text{Final} \geq 40$ and $\text{Exam} \geq 40$: You **pass**, with mark $\text{Final}$.
  
* If $\text{Final} \geq 40$ but $\text{Exam} < 40$: You fail, with mark "**40V**"
  
* If $\text{Final} < 40$: You **fail**, with mark $\text{Final}$.


## Failing

**Q.** *What happens if I fail the module?*

Students who fail the module will typically take a "second attempt" or "capped" resit in the summer (13--23 August 2024).

The maximum mark you can then get is 40.

## Missing the exam

**Q.** *What happens if I miss the exam?*

If you miss the exam because you forgot the date, or went to the wrong place, you score **"AB"** (absent) and fail the module.

## Missing the exam (2)

**Q.** *What happens if I miss the exam?*

If it is impossible for you to make the exam -- say, because of illness or completely unavoidable and unpredictable transport issues -- you can make a mitigating circumstances application in the usual way. This will require evidence, and should be done as soon as possible.

A typical outcome is you can take a "first attempt" or "uncapped" resit in the summer (13--23 August 2024).


## How much should I write? {.smaller}

**Q.** *How much should I write in the exam?*

* **Section A:**
  * Just a single multi-choice letter
  * Rough work will not be marked

* **Section B:**
  * Usually: a clear answer, and very brief working/justification
  * but use context clues...

* **Section C:**
  * Use context clues...
  
## How much should I write: Section C {.smaller}

**Q.** *How much should I write in the exam?*

* Look in the right margin for numbers of marks:
  * **[1]** usually means no working required
  * **[2]** usually needs brief working/justification
  * **[3] or more** usually requires detailed explanations, full sentences, etc. Usually some marks are not just for mathematical accuracy but for quality and clarity of explanatory writing
  
* Look for the "instruction verb":
  * **"State", "Write down"** usually means no working required
  * **"Calculate", "What is...", "Work out"** usually needs brief working justification
  * **"Explain", "Justify", "Prove", "Show that"** usually requires detailed explanations, full sentences, etc. 
    * especially **"Explain carefully..."**
  
## Random variables

**Q.** *Do I need to remember facts about the distributions (binomial, exponential...)? Which facts?*

Yes!

* "What is the expectation of a Beta$(1,4)$ random variable?
* State the PMF of Binomial$(10, 0.4)$ distribution.

...are fair questions!

But for lengthy Section C questions, I'll usually remind you of important things.

## Discrete distributions {.smaller}

| Distribution | Range | PMF | Expectation | Variance |
|:----|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| **Bernoulli:** $\text{Bern}(p)$ | $\{0,1\}$ | $p(0) = 1- p$, $p(1) = p$ | $p$ | $p(1-p)$ |
| **Binomial:** $\text{Bin}(n,p)$ | $\{0,1,\dots,n\}$ | $\displaystyle\binom{n}{x} p^x (1-p)^{n-x}$ | $np$ | $np(1-p)$ |
| **Geometric:** $\text{Geom}(p)$ | $\{1,2,\dots\}$ | $(1-p)^{x-1}p$ | $\displaystyle\frac{1}{p}$ | $\displaystyle\frac{1-p}{p^2}$ |
| **Poisson:** $\text{Po}(\lambda)$ | $\{0,1,\dots\}$ | $\mathrm{e}^{-\lambda} \displaystyle\frac{\lambda^x}{x!}$ | $\lambda$ | $\lambda$ |

## Continuous distributions {.smaller}

| Distribution | Range | PDF | Expectation | Variance |
|:-----|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| **Exponential:** $\text{Exp}(\lambda)$ | $\mathbb R_+$ | $\lambda \mathrm e^{-\lambda x}$ | $\displaystyle\frac{1}{\lambda}$ | $\displaystyle\frac{1}{\lambda^2}$ |
| **Normal:** $\mathrm N(\mu,\sigma^2)$ | $\mathbb R$ | ${\displaystyle{\small \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} \exp \left( - \frac{(x - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2} \right)}}$ | $\mu$ | $\sigma^2$ |
| **Beta:** $\text{Beta}(\alpha, \beta)$ | $[0,1]$ | $\propto x^{\alpha - 1}(1-x)^{\beta - 1}$ | $\displaystyle\frac{\alpha}{\alpha + \beta}$ | ${\displaystyle{\small \frac{\alpha\beta}{(\alpha + \beta)^2(\alpha + \beta + 1)}}}$ |

  
## Interpolation {.smaller}

**Q.** *When using statistical tables, do I need to use interpolation, or can I just take the nearest value in the table?*

You do not need to use interpolation.

. . .

I *think* I have written the exam so all values are ones in the table. If your value is not in the table, either:

* You have made a mistake. Check your working.
  * (Maybe you have forgotten to use a continuity correction in an approximation question?)
* I have made a mistake in writing the question.
  * Sorry! Pick the nearest value in the table.

## Statistical tables

**Q.** *I have a normal distribution button on my calculator. Do I have to bother with the tables?*

. . .

If a question says *"Let $X \sim \text{N}(12, 4^2)$. What is $\mathbb P(X \geq 11)$?"* any method is fine!

If a question says *"Let $X \sim \text{N}(12, 4^2)$. Using the statistical tables on p9, find $\mathbb P(X \geq 11)$?"*, we are looking for evidence of using statistical tables:

* Standardising, to convert to $\mathbb P(Z \leq -0.25) = \Phi(-0.25)$
* Converting to $\Phi(z)$ for $z \geq$, to get $\Phi(-0.25) = 1 - \Phi(+0.25)$
* I don't care if you get $\Phi(0.25)$ from tables or calculator

Not showing the standardising/conversion steps would lose you amrks.
  
## Bookwork and rider

* **"Bookwork"** are questions about facts from the module or totally standard exercises.
* A **"rider"** is a question following on from bookwork that *uses* the bookwork to answer a harder question.

## Bookwork and rider: example {.smaller}

**2022--23 paper, Question C1**

**(a)** Define what it means for $A_1, A_2, \dots, A_n$ to be a *partition*.

**(b)** Prove the law of total probability.

. . .

An airline has three levels of membership in their reward scheme: Bronze (representing 40% of members), Silver (40% of members), and Gold (20% of members).

The airline estimates that each year 30% of Bronze members, 50% of Silver members, and 80% of Gold members will book a flight with the airline. (In this simplified model, no members book multiple flights.)

**(c)** What proportion of all members will take a flight with the airline in the next year?

# Your questions...

# A past exam question

## 2022--23, Question C2

Recall that we say a random variable $X$ has an *exponential distribution* with rate $\lambda > 0$, and write $X \sim \text{Exp}(\lambda)$, if its range is the non-negative real numbers $\mathbb R_+$ and its probability density function is $f(x) = \lambda \mathrm{e}^{-\lambda x}$.

**(a)** Let $X \sim \text{Exp}(\lambda)$. Show that its cumulative distribution function is given by $F(x) = 1-\mathrm{e}^{-\lambda x}$ for $x \geq 0$. [[2]]{style="float: right"}

---

## {.smaller}

**(a)** Let $X \sim \text{Exp}(\lambda)$. Show that its cumulative distribution function is given by $F(x) = 1-\mathrm{e}^{-\lambda x}$ for $x \geq 0$. [[2]]{style="float: right"}

::: {style="color: blue;"}
The CDF is
\begin{align*}
F(x) &= \int_{-\infty}^{x} f(y) \, \mathrm{d}y \\
  &= \int_0^x \lambda \mathrm{e}^{-\lambda y} \, \mathrm{d}y \\
  &= \big[ -\mathrm{e}^{-\lambda y} \big]_0^x \\
  &= -\mathrm{e}^{-\lambda x} - (-1) \\
  &= 1-\mathrm{e}^{-\lambda x} .
\end{align*}
In the second line, the integral is 0 for all $y < 0$.
:::

**(b)** It is known that a certain type of lightbulb has a lifetime until breaking that, measured in years, is well modelled by an exponential distribution with rate $\lambda = \frac12$. What is the probability such a lightbulb lasts for more than 4 years? [[2]]{style="float: right"}

::: {style="color: blue;"}
$$ \mathbb P(X \geq 4) = 1 - F(4) = 1 - \big(1 - \mathrm{e}^{-\frac12 \times 4}\big) = \mathrm{e}^{-2} = 0.135. $$
where we used the expression for $F(x)$ from part (a), with $\lambda = \tfrac12$.
:::

---

**(c)** Write down some R code using the \texttt{pexp()} function that would calculate the answer to part (b) and would round that answer to 3 significant figures. [[1]]{style="float: right"}


. . .

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
answer <- pexp(4, 1 / 2, lower.tail = FALSE)
signif(answer, digits = 3)
```

## {.smaller}

**(d)** A room is lit by 5 of these lightbulbs. What is the probability that at least one of the lightbulb breaks within the first year? (You may assume the lifetimes of the lightbulbs are independent.) [[4]]{style="float: right"}

. . .

::: {style="color: blue;"}
The probability at least one lightbulb breaks with the year is
$$ \mathbb P(\geq 1 \text{ lightbulb breaks}) = 1 - \mathbb P(\text{no lightbulb breaks}) . $$

The probability a single lightbulb outlasts the year is
$$
\mathbb P(\text{lighbulb doesn't break}) = \mathbb P(X > 1) = 1 - F(1) 
= 1 - \big(1 - \mathrm{e}^{-\frac12 \times 1}\big) = \mathrm{e}^{-\frac12} .
$$

Since the lifetimes are independent, the probability no lightbulbs break is
$$ \mathbb P(\text{no lightbulb breaks}) = \mathbb P(\text{lightbulb doesn't break})^5 = \mathrm{e}^{-\frac12 \times 5} = 0.082 $$

So 
$$ \mathbb P(\geq 1 \text{ lightbulb breaks}) = 1 - 0.082 = 0.918 . $$
:::

---

## {.smaller}

**(e)** Suppose that one of these lightbulbs has so far been operating for two years. By calculating the conditional probability $\mathbb P(X \geq 2 + x \mid X \geq 2)$, or otherwise, show that the remaining lifetime of the bulb is still exponentially distributed with rate $\lambda = \frac12$. [[4]]{style="float: right"}

. . .

::: {style="color: blue;"}
As suggested, we have
\begin{align*}
\mathbb P(X \geq 2 + x \mid X \geq 2)
  &= \frac{\mathbb P(X \geq 2 + x \text{ and } X \geq 2)}{\mathbb P(X \geq 2)} \\
  &= \frac{\mathbb P(X \geq 2)}{\mathbb P(X \geq 2)} \\
  &= \frac{\mathrm{e}^{-\frac12(2+x)}}{\mathrm{e}^{-\frac12 \times 2}} \\
  &= \mathrm{e}^{-\tfrac12x}
\end{align*}
where the condition $X \geq 2$ in the numerator was already satisfied if $X \geq 2+x$.

But this is exactly $\mathbb P(X > x) = 1 - F(x)$ for an $\text{Exp}(\tfrac12)$ random variable. Hence the remaining lifetime after $X = 2$ is still exponential with rate 2.
:::

## {.smaller}

**(f)** In this question, we modelled the lifetimes of the lightbulbs as being IID $\text{Exp}(\frac12)$ distributions. Explain two ways in which the model could be improved. [[4]]{style="float: right"}

. . .

Lots of possible answers. Eg:

::: {style="color: blue;"}
* Different distribution: eg not memoryless exponential, but one that "degrades over time"
* Not independent: eg to allow for "faulty batches" of lightbulbs
* Different parameter $\lambda$:  eg based on testing or on historical data.
* Not identically distributed: eg living room light is used a lot and may break sooner than attic light, which is only used rarely
