# About the exam

## Exam arrangements

* Check your exam timetable for the date and time of the exam.
  * For most people (without unusual clashes or special arrangements), the exam will happen on **Monday 15 January at 1400**.
* The exam will happen in person on campus.
  * Location to be announced at the end of this week.
* The exam will last for 2 hours (except for some students with special arrangements).

## Exam arrangements (2)

* You are allowed to use a basic non-programmable calculator for the exam.
  * More later...
* The exam will be **"closed-book"** style: you are not permitted to bring notes into the exam hall.
* A page of [statistical tables for the normal distribution](https://mpaldridge.github.io/math1710/stat-tab.pdf) will be on the final page of the exam paper.
* There will not be a formula book.

## Passing the module

* The exam makes up 70% of your mark for this module. The pass mark for this module is 40%. You must pass the exam to pass the module. The pass mark for the exam is also 40%, or 32 marks out of 80.

# Structure of the Exam

## Exam structure

The exam will be in three sections:

* **Section A:** 10 short multiple-choice questions (25% of marks)
* **Section B:** 10 short questions (25% of marks)
* **Section C:** 2 multi-part long questions (50% of marks)

## Section A

* 10 multiple-choice questions
* 2 marks each
* Total of 20 marks

These each require a single letter answer. No rough work will be read or marked.

You will enter these letter answers on a multiple-choice "bubble sheet".

*Recommended time: 3 minutes per question; 30 minutes total*

## Section B

* 10 single-part "short answer" questions
* 2 marks each
* Total of 20 marks

These require a clear answer and brief working or explanation. Typically, a correct answer with clear working will get 2 marks; partial progress or a correct answer with totally inadequate working will get 1 mark.

You will answer these in an answer booklet.

*Recommended time: 3 minutes per question; 30 minutes total*

## Section C

* 2 multi-part "long answer" questions
* 20 marks each
* Total of 40 marks

Parts of these questions require full detailed answers, as in assessed work from problem sheets, and will have marks set aside for quality of explanations.

You will answer these in the same answer booklet as Section B.

*Recommended time: 30 minutes per question; 1 hour total.*

# Past papers

## Past papers

School of Maths policy is that for Level 1 modules, the three most recent past papers (with the same format) are available.

* The **2022--23** paper (from January 2023)
* The **2021--22** paper (from January 2022)
* *Not the 2020--21 paper, as this was held in pandemic times, and had a different format.*
* The **2019--20** paper (from January 2020)

These are all available from Minerva.

## Checksheets

* University policy is that we are not permitted to give out complete worked solutions to past exam papers.

* Instead, I have provided a "checksheet" for the three past papers 2021-22, 2019--20 and 2018--19.
  *This should give enough information for you to check your own answers, if you use the papers for your revision, but is rather bare-bones and doesn't give a lot of detail.

* I am happy to discuus exam questions at office hours

## Checksheets (2)

I strongly recommend using all these past papers as part of your revision, and resisting the temptation to peek at the checksheet before trying the questions yourself, perhaps multiple times.

You may wish to test yourself by trying one of the papers sight-unseen under exam-like conditions.

## Notes on past papers

Some notes on the past papers:

* 2021-22 paper:
  * Written by me, reflecting the module as taught this year
  * Excellent revision paper!
* 2021-22 paper:
  * Written by me, reflecting the module as taught this year
  * A bit too hard! You should be able to score about 10% higher on your exam than this paper
  
## Notes on past papers (2)

* 2019--20 paper:
  * Not written by me, reflecting the module as someone else taught it
  * The material is almost identical, but some notation is different:
    * Eg. $\Pr(A)$ and $\mathrm{E}[X]$; not $\mathbb P(A)$ and $\mathbb EX$.
  * You are not expected to be able to answer Question B9
  * In Question A8, all the multi-choice options are wrong!


# Exam FAQs

## Calculators

**Q.** *Can I use a calculator in the exam?*

Yes! You may use a *basic, non-programmable* calculator in the MATH1710 exam.

## Calculators (2) {.smaller}

*"**Note that Calculators are only allowed in certain exams.** The module leader will be able to tell you whether a calculator can be used on the exam for their module. *

*"Where calculators can be used in MATH coded exams:*

* *Any basic (i.e., non-programmable) calculator is allowed.*
* *Calculators that can solve calculus problems or do matrix calculations are allowed if they are non-programmable. Examples of commonly used calculators that are allowed include the Casio FX-85 series and the Casio FX991 series.*
* *If you are not sure whether your calculator is non-programmable then check the manufacturer's website. Any calculator that is marketed as 'programmable' or 'graphic' is unlikely to be allowed in an exam. *

*"**Please note:** the school does not provide a definitive list of approved and non-approved calculators. The school do not verify / pre-approve calculators (some other schools may provide verification stickers but these are not needed for MATH exams). The exam invigilators will check calculators during the examination."*

## R questions on the exam

**Q.** *Can there be R questions on the exam?*
:::

Yes!

* *"What would the output from R be if you entered the code..."*
* *""Write down some R code that would calculate..."*

Your exam has two short questions on R, totalling 4 marks (5% of the exam).

---



**A1.** What would the output from the following R code be?

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
data <- 1:10
round(sd(data), digits = 2)
```

**A:** 3.03  
**B:** 5.5  
**C:** 6.36  
**D:** 9.17  
**E** 40.5

. . .

**Answer.** This is asking for the standard deviation of $(1,2,3,...,9,10)$, which is **A:** 3.03.

---


**B4.** In RStudio, a vector `x` contains the values in the range of a discrete random variable $X$ and a vector `p` contains the corresponding probabilities. Write down an R command to evaluate $\mathbb EX(X-1)$ from `x` and `p`.

. . .

By the law of the unconscious statistician, this is calculated by
$$ \mathbb EX(X-1) = \sum_x x(x-1)\,p(x) . $$

This can be calculated with the R code
```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
sum(x * (x - 1) * p)
```

## Passing

**Q.** *What is the pass mark for this module?*

* Your coursework (Problem Sheets and R Worksheets) will be converted to a mark out of 100.
* Your exam mark will be converted to a mark out of 100.

$$ \text{Final} = 0.70 \times \text{Exam} + 0.30 \times \text{CW} $$

* You must have a final mark of at least 40 *and an exam mark of at least 40* to pass the module.

- - -

$$ \text{Final} = 0.70 \times \text{Exam} + 0.30 \times \text{CW} $$

* If $\text{Final} \geq 40$ and $\text{Exam} \geq 40$: You **pass**, with mark $\text{Final}$.
  
* If $\text{Final} \geq 40$ but $\text{Exam} < 40$: You fail, with mark "**40V**"
  
* If $\text{Final} < 40$: You **fail**, with mark $\text{Final}$.
