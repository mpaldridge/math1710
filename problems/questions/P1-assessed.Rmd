**C1.** The monthly average exchange rate for US dollars into British pounds over a 12-month period was:
\begin{gather*}

1.317, \ 1.304, \ 1.284, \ 1.268, \ 1.247, \ 1.215.

**(d)** Is the mode an appropriate summary statistic for this sort of data? Why/why not?

*Hint.*
Is there a unique mode for this data? Why/why not? For what sort of data does the "mode" give us useful answers?

Â **(a)** Prove the following computational formula for the sample covariance:
\[ s_{xy} = \frac{1}{n-1} \left( \sum_{i=1}^n x_iy_i - n\bar x \bar y \right). \]

*Hint.*
In Subsection 1.4 of the notes, we went from the definitional formula for the sample *variance* to a computational formula. Can you follow a similar argument here?

**(b)** Suppose that a dataset $\mathbf x = (x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n)$ (with $n \geq 2$) has sample variance $s_x^2 = 0$. Show that all the datapoints are in fact equal.

*Hint.*
When is the square of something equal to 0? What can you say about the value of a square when it's nonzero? What can you say about a "sum of squares" -- that is, some numbers squared then added together?
