**(a)** Prove the following computational formula for the sample covariance:
\[ s_{xy} = \frac{1}{n-1} \left( \sum_{i=1}^n x_iy_i - n\bar x \bar y \right). \]

**(b)** Suppose that a dataset $\mathbf x = (x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n)$ (with $n \geq 2$) has sample variance $s_x^2 = 0$. Show that all the datapoints are in fact equal.
