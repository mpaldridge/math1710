**B1.**  In a survey of 100 people, 40 liked tea, 35 liked coffee, and 15 liked both tea and coffee. By drawing a Venn diagram, or otherwise, find the probability that a person chosen at random:

:::: {.subq}
**(a)** Likes only tea.

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.* 
Using the notation $| \cdot |$ to denote the number of people, we have
\[
|\text{Likes only tea}| = |\text{Likes tea}| - |\text{Likes tea and coffee}| = 40-15 = 25.
\]
Therefore
        \[
       \mathbb P(\text{Likes only tea}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
       \]

**(b)** Likes neither tea nor coffee.

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.*
\[
|\text{Likes tea or coffee}| = |\text{Likes only tea}| + |\text{Likes coffee}| = 25+35 = 60.
\]
Therefore $100-60=40$ people like neither tea nor coffee, so
       \begin{align*}
       \mathbb P(\text{Likes neither}) = \frac{40}{100} = 0.4
       \end{align*}

**(c)** Likes tea given that they like coffee.

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.* 
       \[
       \mathbb P(\text{Likes Tea | Likes Coffee}) = \frac{\mathbb P(\text{Likes Tea and Coffee})}{\mathbb P(\text{Likes Coffee})} = \frac{15}{35} = 0.4286
       \]

**B2.** A factory produces 80% of its goods in Factory A and 20% in Factory B. The probability of a defective item from Factory A is 0.05, and from Factory B, it is 0.1.

**(b)**     Calculate the probability that a randomly selected item is defective.

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.*
By multiplying the probabilities along the branches of the tree and adding the probabilities:
 \begin{align*}
   \mathbb P(\text{Defective}) &= 0.8 \times 0.05 + 0.2 \times 0.1 \\
   &= 0.04 + 0.02 = 0.06
   \end{align*}

**B3.** A magician has prepared two piles of cards taken from a standard deck of cards. In the first pile he has put the 3, 4 and 5 of hearts; in the second pile he has the 2 of spades and a second numbered spade, which we denote as $x$. A member of the audience is invited to pick one card at random from each pack and multiply the two numbers together.

**(a)**     Draw a sample space diagram giving all possible products (in terms of $x$).

**(b)**     Calculate the probability that the product is even in the two cases that (i) $x$ is odd and (ii) $x$ is even.

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.*
(i) If $x$ is odd, then 4 of the 6 products in the sample space are even, namely 6, 12, 14 and $6x$. Therefore 
\[
\mathbb P (\text {Even product}) = \frac{4}{6} = \frac{2}{3}. 
\]
(ii) If $x$ is even, then all 6 products in the sample space are even. Therefore 
\[
\mathbb P (\text {Even product}) = \frac{6}{6} = 1. 
\]
:::

:::: {.subq}
**(c)**     The magician knows that the probability that the product is even is equal to the probability that the product is greater than 10. Find the value of $x$.


::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.*
Since 6 is a possible product, 
\[
\mathbb P (\text{Product} > 10) \neq 1.
\]
Therefore, using the results from (b), $x$ must be an odd number and
\[
\mathbb P (\text{Product} > 10) = \frac{2}{3}.
\]
This means that exactly two out of $3x,$ $6x$ and $7x$ must be greater than 10. If $x \geq 4$, then all three values would be greater than 10, and if $x \leq 1$ then only one would be. Therefore the only possible values of $x$ are 2 and 3. The two spade cards must be different to each other, so $x=3$.

**B3.**  A company has three machines: Machine A, Machine B, and Machine C. Machine A produces 40% of the total output, Machine B produces 35%, and Machine C produces the remaining 25%. The defect rates for the machines are 1%, 2%, and 3%, respectively. If a product is chosen at random and is found to be defective, what is the probability it was produced by Machine B?

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.* 
Recall that
 \begin{align*}
   \mathbb P(B | \text{Defective}) &= \frac{\mathbb P(B \cap \text{Defective})}{\mathbb P(\text{Defective})}\\
   &= \frac{\mathbb P(B) \mathbb P(\text{Defective | B})}{\mathbb P(\text{Defective})}. \\
 \end{align*}
Using a probability tree (draw it!),
 \begin{align*}
 \mathbb P(\text{Defective}) &= \mathbb P(A) \mathbb P(\text{Defective | A}) + \mathbb P(B) \mathbb P(\text{Defective | B}) + \mathbb P(C) \mathbb P(\text{Defective | C}) \\
 &= 0.40 \times 0.01 + 0.35 \times 0.02 + 0.25 \times 0.03 \\
 &= 0.0185.
 \end{align*}
 Therefore
 \[
   \mathbb P(B | \text{Defective}) =\frac{0.35 \times 0.02}{0.0185} =  0.3784
 \]
