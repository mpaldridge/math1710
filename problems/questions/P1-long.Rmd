**B1.** For each of the two datasets below, calculate the following summary statistics, or explain why it is not possible to do so: mode; median; mean; number of distinct outcomes; inter-quartile range; and sample variance.

**(a)** Total numbers of Skittles colours in a large packet of six mini-packets:

("Skittles" are a small coloured fruit-flavoured candy, if it matters.)

**B2.** A summary statistic is informally said to be "robust" if it typically doesn't change much if a small number of outliers are introduced to a large dataset, or "sensitive" if it often changes a lot when a small number of outliers are introduced. Briefly discuss the robustness or sensitivity of the following summary statistics: **(a)** mode; **(b)** median; **(c)** mean; **(d)** number of distinct outcomes; **(e)** inter-quartile range; and **(f)** sample variance.

**B3.** Let $\mathbf a = (a_1, a_2, \dots a_n)$ and $\mathbf b = (b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n)$ be two real-valued vectors of the same length. Then the *Cauchy--Schwarz inequality* says that
\[ \left( \sum_{i=1}^n a_i b_i \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2 \right) \left(\sum_{i=1}^n b_i^2 \right) . \]
Use the Cauchy--Schwarz inequality to show that the correlation $r_{xy}$ satisfies $-1 \leq r_{xy} \leq 1$.

(*Hint:* Try to prove that $s_{xy}^2 \leq s_x^2 s_y^2$. How does this help?)

**B4.** A researcher wishes to study the effect of mental health on academic achievement. The researcher will collect data on the mental health of a cohort of students by asking them to fill in a questionnaire, and will measure academic achievement via the students' scores on their university exams. Discuss some of the ethical issues associated with the collection, storage, and analysis of this data, and with the publication of the results of the analysis. Are there ways to mitigate these issues?

(It's not necessary to write an essay for this question -- a few short bulletpoints will suffice. There may be an opportunity to discuss these issues in more detail in your tutorial.)
