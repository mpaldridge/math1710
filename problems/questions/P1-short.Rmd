**A1.** Consider again the "number of Skittles in each packet" data from Example 1.1.
\[ 59, \ 59, \ 59, \ 59, \ 60, \ 60, \ 60, \ 61, \ 62, \ 62, \ 62, \ 63, \ 63 .\]

**(a)** Calculate the mean number of Skittles in each packet.

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.*
This was in the notes:
\[ \bar x = \frac{1}{13} (59 + 59 + \cdots + 63) =  \frac{789}{13} = 60.7 .\]

**(b)** Calculate the sample variance using the computational formula.

*Solution.*
\begin{align*}
  s_x^2 &= \frac{1}{13 - 1} \left( (59^2 + 59^2 + \cdots + 63^2) - 13 \times 60.6923^2)\right) \\
        &= \frac{1}{12} (47915 - 47886.2) \\
        &= 2.40

**(c)** Calculate the sample variance using the definitional formula.

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.*
\begin{align*}
  s_x^2 &= \frac{1}{13 - 1} \left( (59 - 60.7)^2 + (59 - 60.7)^2 + \cdots + (63 - 60.7)^2 \right) \\
        &= \frac{1}{12} (2.86 + 2.86 + \cdots + 5.33) \\
        &= \frac{1}{12} \times 28.77 \\
        &= 2.40

**(d)** Out of (b) and (c), which calculation did you find easier, and why?

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.*
The computational formula required fewer presses of the calculator buttons, because $\sum_i x_i^2$ is fewer button-presses than $\sum_i (x_i - \bar x)^2$, where you have to subtract the means before squaring.

On the other hand, the expression inside the brackets of the computational formula is a fairly small number given as the difference of two very large numbers, so it was necessary to use lots of decimal places of accuracy to make sure the subtraction cancelled correctly.

**A2.** Consider the following data sets of the age of elected politicians on a local council. (The "18--30" consists of people older than and including 18, and younger than but *not* including 30.)

**(b)** What is the median age bin?

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.* The 10th- and 11th-largest observations are both in the 45--50 bin, which is therefore the median bin.

**(c)** Calculate (an approximation of) the mean age of the politicians.

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.*
Pretending that each person is in the centre of their bin, we have
\[ \bar x = \frac{1}{20} (24 + 35 + \cdots + 65) = \frac{946.5}{20} = 47.3 . \]
