**A2.** Consider the following data sets of the age of elected politicians on a local council. (The "18--30" consists of people older than and including 18, and younger than but *not* including 30.)

|   Age (years)    | Frequency | Relative frequency | Frequency density |
|:---------------:|:---------:|:------------------:|:-----------------:|
|   18--30   |     1     |            |             |
