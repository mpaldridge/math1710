**C1.** Let $A$ and $B$ be two events with $\mathbb P(A) = 0.8$ and $\mathbb P(B) = 0.4$. The following questions concern the value of $\mathbb P(A \cap B)$, the probability that both $A$ and $B$ occur.

::: {.subq}
**(a)** Prove the upper bound $\mathbb P(A \cap B) \leq 0.4$.
:::

::: {.subq}
**(b)** Prove that this upper bound can be achieved, by giving an example of a sample space $\Omega$, a probability measure $\mathbb P$ and events $A, B \subset \Omega$ such that $\mathbb P(A) = 0.8$ and $\mathbb P(B) = 0.4$, with equality  $\mathbb P(A \cap B) = 0.4$ in the upper bound.
:::

::: {.subq}
**(c)** Give a lower bound for $\mathbb P(A \cap B)$ -- that is, prove that $\mathbb P(A \cap B) \geq \text{something}$ -- and show that this lower bound can be achieved. (Try to work out the correct bound, even if you can't formally prove it.)

**C2.** A "random digit" is a number chosen at random from $\{0, 1, \dots, 9\}$, each with equal probability. A statistician choses $n$ random digits.

::: {.subq}
**(a)** For $k = 0, 1, \dots, 9$, let $A_k$ be the event that all the digits are $k$ or smaller. What is the probability of $A_k$, as a function of $k$ and $n$?
:::

::: {.subq}
**(b)** Let $B_k$ be the event that the largest digit chosen is equal to $k$. What is the probability of $B_k$? Justify your answer carefully.
