**C1** Let $A$ and $B$ be two events with $\mathbb P(A) = 0.8$ and $\mathbb P(B) = 0.4$. The following questions concern the value of $\mathbb P(A \cap B)$, the probability that both $A$ and $B$ occur.

::: {.subq}
**(a)** Prove the upper bound $\mathbb P(A \cap B) \leq 0.4$.
:::

::: {.subq}
**(b)** Prove that this upper bound can be achieved, by giving an example of a sample space $\Omega$, a probability measure $\mathbb P$ and events $A, B \subset \Omega$ such that $\mathbb P(A) = 0.8$ and $\mathbb P(B) = 0.4$, with equality  $\mathbb P(A \cap B) = 0.4$ in the upper bound.

::: {.subq}
**(c)** Give a lower bound for $\mathbb P(A \cap B)$ -- that is, prove that $\mathbb P(A \cap B) \geq \text{something}$ -- and show that this lower bound can be achieved. (Try to work out the correct bound, even if you can't formally prove it.)
