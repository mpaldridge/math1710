**C1.** Let $A$ and $B$ be two events with $\mathbb P(A) = 0.8$ and $\mathbb P(B) = 0.4$. The following questions concern the value of $\mathbb P(A \cap B)$, the probability that both $A$ and $B$ occur.

:::: {.subq}
**(a)** Prove the upper bound $\mathbb P(A \cap B) \leq 0.4$.

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Hint.*
Can you find an event $C$ with $A \cap B \subset C$ that will allow you to use the result $\mathbb P(A \cap B) \leq C$?
:::

:::: {.subq}
**(b)** Prove that this upper bound can be achieved, by giving an example of a sample space $\Omega$, a probability measure $\mathbb P$ and events $A, B \subset \Omega$ such that $\mathbb P(A) = 0.8$ and $\mathbb P(B) = 0.4$, with equality  $\mathbb P(A \cap B) = 0.4$ in the upper bound.

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Hint.*
Try a sample space with five outcomes $\Omega = \{a,b,c,d,e\}$ and the classical "equally likely" probability. How many elements are in $A$? How many in $B$? How many in the overlap $A \cap B$?
:::

:::: {.subq}
**(c)** Give a lower bound for $\mathbb P(A \cap B)$ -- that is, prove that $\mathbb P(A \cap B) \geq \text{something}$ -- and show that this lower bound can be achieved. (Try to work out the correct bound, even if you can't formally prove it.)

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Hint.*
Try the sample space with five-equally likely outcomes again. How small can you make the overlap $A \cap B$?

::::: {.myq}
**C1.** Let $\Omega$ be a sample space with a probability measure $\mathbb P$, and let $A, B \subset \Omega$ be events. For each of the following statements, state whether the statement is true or false (that is, always true or sometimes false). If it is true, briefly justify the statement; if it is false, give a counterexample.

:::: {.subq}
**(a)** If $\mathbb P(A) \leq \mathbb P(B)$, then $A \subset B$.

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Hint.* Try to find a counterexample. Make sure you're paying attention to the direction of implication (the other direction is true).
<!--
*Solution.* False. It is true that *if* $A \subset B$ *then* $\mathbb P(A) \leq \mathbb P(B)$, but here the implication is the wrong way around.

For a counterexample, consider rolling a dice, and let $A = \{1\}$ and $B = \{2,3\}$. Then $\mathbb P(A) = \frac16 \leq \frac26 = \mathbb P(B)$, but it's not true that $A \subset B$.-->

:::: {.subq}
**(b)** $\mathbb P(A \cap B) + \mathbb P(A \cap B^{\mathsf{c}}) = \mathbb P(A)$.

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Hint.* Is there a relevant disjoint union here?
<!--
*Solution.* True. Note that $(A \cap B) \cup (A \cap B^{\mathsf{c}}) = A$ and that the union is disjoint. (Try drawing a Venn diagram, if this isn't obvious.) The result follows from applying Axiom 3.-->
:::
::::

:::: {.subq}
**(c)** $\mathbb P(A \cup B) \leq \mathbb P(A)$

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Hint.* You'd expect the inequality to be the other way round -- so it should be possible to find a counterexample. <!--
*Solution.* False. The same $A$ and $B$ as in part (a) gives a concrete counterexample. The statement would be true with a reversed inequality, or with the union replaced by an intersection. -->
:::
::::

:::: {.subq}
**(d)** If $A$ and $B$ are disjoint, then $\mathbb P((A \cup B)^{\mathsf{c}}) = 1 - \mathbb P(A) - \mathbb P(B)$.

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Hint.* Can you use the complement rule to start off with? <!--
*Solution.* True. From the complement rule, we have $\mathbb P((A \cup B)^{\mathsf{c}}) = 1 - \mathbb P(A \cup B)$; then from the addition rule for disjoint unions we have $\mathbb P(A \cup B) = \mathbb P(A) + \mathbb P(B)$. Putting these together gives the result.-->

**C2.** An urn contains 15 balls: 4 red balls, 5 blue balls, and 6 green balls.

:::: {.subq}
**(a)** If three balls are drawn *with* replacement, what is the probability that all three balls are the *same* colour?

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Hint.* If $A$ is the event all three balls are the same colour, then we have a disjoint union $A = A_{\text{red}} \cup A_{\text{blue}} \cup A_{\text{green}}$, where $A_{\text{red}}$ is the event all three balls are red, and so on.
:::
::::

:::: {.subq}
**(b)** If three balls are drawn *without* replacement, what is the probability that all three balls are *different* colours?

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Hint.* One way to do this is to look at the ordered collection of balls, and look at all $3!$ possible orderings red-blue-green, red-green-blue, etc.

Another way is to look at the unordered collection, so the denominator is $\binom{15}{3}$.
