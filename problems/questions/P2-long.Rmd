**B1** Starting from just the three probability axioms, prove the following statements:

:::: {.subq}
**(a)** $\mathbb P(\varnothing) = 0$.

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.* As always, we seek a disjoint union, to allow us to use Axiom 3.

Let $A$ be any event (such as $A = \varnothing$ or $A = \Omega$). Then $A \cup \varnothing = A$, and the union is disjoint -- since $\varnothing$ contains no sample points, it certainly can't contain any sample points that are also in $A$. Then applying Axiom 3, we get $\mathbb P(A) + \mathbb P(\varnothing) = \mathbb P(A)$. Subtracting $\mathbb P(A)$ from both sides gives the result.

*Alternatively*, if you prove part (b) first, you can apply that with $A = \Omega$. Since $\Omega^\comp = \varnothing$ and Axiom 2 tells us that $\mathbb P(\Omega) = 1$, the result follows.

**(b)** $\mathbb P(A^\comp) = 1 - \mathbb P(A)$.

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.* A very useful and relevant disjoint union is $A \cup A^\comp = \Omega$. Applying Axiom 3 gives us $\mathbb P(A) + \mathbb P(A^\comp) = \mathbb P(\Omega)$. But Axiom 2 tells us that $\mathbb P(\Omega) = 1$, so  $\mathbb P(A) + \mathbb P(A^\comp) = 1$. Rearranging gives the result.

**B2.** Suppose we pick a number at random from the set $\{1, 2, \dots, 2021\}$.

:::: {.subq}
**(a)** What is the probability that the number is divisible by 5?

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.* The sample space is $\Omega = \{1, 2, \dots, 2021\}$, and $A$ is the set of numbers up to 2021 that are divisible by 5. Clearly $|\Omega| = 2021$. Further, $|A|$ is the largest integer no bigger than $\frac{2021}{5} = 404.2$, which is 404, as this is how many times 5 "goes into" 2021.  Hence
\[ \mathbb P(A) = \frac{|A|}{|\Omega|} = \frac{404}{2021} = 0.1999 , \]
just a tiny bit smaller than $\frac{1}{5}$.
:::
::::

:::: {.subq}
**(b)** What is the probability the number is divisible by 5 or by 7?

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.* With the same $\Omega$ and $A$, we now have $B$ being the numbers up to 2021 divisible by $7$; so we're looking for $\mathbb P(A \cup B)$. As before, $|B|$ is the largest integer no bigger that $\frac{2021}{7} = 288.7$, which is $288$. So
\[ \mathbb P(A \cup B) = \frac{404}{2021} + \frac{288}{2021} - \mathbb P(A\cap B) . \]
Here, $A \cap B$ is the numbers divisible by both 5 and 7, which is precisely the numbers divisible by $5 \times 7 = 35$. Then $|A \cap B|$ is $\frac{2021}{35} = 57.7$ rounded down. So finally, we have
\[ \mathbb P(A \cup B) = \frac{404}{2021} + \frac{288}{2021} - \frac{57}{2021} = \frac{635}{2021} = 0.314. \]

**B3.** In this question, you will have to use the standard two-event form of the addition rule for unions
\[ \mathbb P(A \cup B) = \mathbb P(A) + \mathbb P(B) - \mathbb P(A \cap B) . \]

*[**Update:** This question has been edited to provide extra hints.]*

**(a)** Using the two-event addition rule, show that
\[ \mathbb P(C \cup D \cup E) = \mathbb P(C) + \mathbb P(D \cup E) - \mathbb P\big(C \cap (D \cup E)\big).  \]

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.* As with the Cauchy--Schwarz question from Problem Sheet 1, the key is to make a good choice for what $A$ and $B$ should be. This time, $A = C$ and $D \cup E$ will work well, since $C \cup (D \cup E) = C \cup D \cup E$. (You can call this "associativity", if you like.) Making that substitution immediately gives us
\[ \mathbb P(C \cup D \cup E) = \mathbb P(C) + \mathbb P(D \cup E) - \mathbb P\big(C \cap (D \cup E)\big) ,  \]
as required.

**(b)** Using the two-event addition rule and the distributive law, or otherwise, prove the three-event form of the addition rule for unions:
\[
  \mathbb P(C \cup D \cup E) = \mathbb P(C) + \mathbb P(D) + \mathbb P(E) 
  - \mathbb P(C \cap D) - \mathbb P(C \cap E) - \mathbb P(D \cap E) + \mathbb P(C \cap D \cap E) .
\]

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.*
Let's take the three terms on the right of the equation from part (a) separately.

The first term is $\mathbb P(C)$, which is fine as it is.

The second term is $\mathbb P(D \cup E)$. This is the probability of the union of two events, so we can use addition rule for the union of two events to get
\[ \mathbb P(D \cup E) = \mathbb P(D) + \mathbb P(E) - \mathbb P(D \cup E) . \]

The third term is $\mathbb P\big(C \cap (D \cup E)\big)$. If we use the distributive law, as suggested in the question, we get $C \cap (D \cup E) = (C \cap D) \cup (C\cap E)$, so we want to find $\mathbb P\big((C \cap D) \cup (C\cap E)\big)$. But this is another union of two events again, this time with $A = C \cap D$ and $B = C \cap E$. So the addition rule gives
\[ \mathbb P\big((C \cap D) \cup (C\cap E)\big) = \mathbb P(C \cap D) + \mathbb P(C \cap E) - \mathbb P(C \cap D \cap E) , \]
since $(C \cap D) \cap (C \cap E) = C \cap D \cap E$.

Finally, we put this all together, and get
\[
  \mathbb P(C \cup D \cup E) = \mathbb P(C) + \mathbb P(D) + \mathbb P(E) 
  - \mathbb P(C \cap D) - \big(\mathbb P(C \cap E) + \mathbb P(D \cap E) - \mathbb P(C \cap D \cap E)\big) ,
\]
which, after taking the minus sign inside the last bracket, is what we wanted.

**B4.** Eight friends are about to sit down at random at a round table. Find the probability that

:::: {.subq}
**(a)** Ashley and Brook sit next to each other, with Chris directly opposite Brook;

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.*
Let $\Omega$ be the number of ways the friends can sit around the table. This is an ordering problem, so $\Omega = 8!$.

Let $A$ be the event in the question. What is $|A|$? Well,

* Ashley can sit anywhere, so has 8 choices of seat.
* Brook can sit either directly to Ashley's left or directly to Ashley's right, so has 2 choices of seat.
* Chris must sit directly opposite Brook, so only has 1 choice of seat.
* The remaining five friends must fill up the remaining seats, so have 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1 choices respectively.

Hence $|A| = 8 \times 2 \times 1 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1$. Thus we get
\[ \mathbb P(A) = \frac{|A|}{|\Omega|} = \frac{8 \times 2 \times 1 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1}{8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = \frac{2 \times 1}{7 \times 6} = \frac{1}{21} . \]

**(b)** neither Ashley, Brook nor Chris sit next to each other.

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.*
The sample space $\Omega$ is as before. Let's count the outcomes in $B$, the event in the question.

* Ashley can sit anywhere, so has 8 choices of seat.
* Chris's number of choices will depend on where Brook sits, so we'll have to count their choices together.
   * If Brook sits next-but-one to Ashley, of which there are 2 choices, then Chris has 3 choices: Chris cannot sit on the seat directly between Ashley and Brook, nor directly next to Ashley on the other side, nor directly next to Brook on the other side.
   * If Brook does not sit next-but-one to Ashley, of which there are 3 choices, then Chris has 2 choices: he cannot sit to the right or left of Ashley, nor to the right or left of Brook.
* The remaining friends have 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1 choices again.
   
Hence, $|B| = 8 \times (2\times 3 + 3 \times 2) \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1$. So
\[ \mathbb P(B) = \frac{|B|}{|\Omega|} = \frac{8 \times (2\times 3 + 3 \times 2) \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1}{8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = \frac{2\times 3 + 3 \times 2}{7 \times 6} = \frac{12}{42} = \frac{2}{7} .  \]

*Alternatively*, last year a MATH1710 student suggested to me the following rather elegant solution. Suppose the five other friends are already sat at a round table with five chairs. Ashley, then Brook, then Chris will each bring along their own chair, and push into one of the gaps between the friends.

Ashley has 5 gaps to choose from, the Brook will have 6, then Chris will have 7, so the total number of ways they can push in is $|\Omega| = 5 \times 6 \times 7$.

To not sit next to each other, Ashley can push in any of the $5$ gaps, Brook only has $6 - 2 = 4$ choices (not in the gap directly to the left or right of Ashley), and Chris only has $7 - 4 = 3$ choices (not in the gaps directly to the left or right of Ashley not of Brook -- these four gaps are distinct). Hence $|B| = 5 \times 4 \times 3$, and we have
\[ \mathbb P(B) = \frac{5 \times 4 \times 3}{5 \times 6 \times 7} = \frac{4 \times 3}{6 \times 7} = \frac{12}{42} = \frac{2}{7}.  \]

**(a)** How many ways can the tutor choose the presentation group?

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}

The tutor is sampling 4 items from 12, without replacement (the same person can't be picked twice) and where the order doesn't matter. So this is

Prove Pascal's formula.

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.*
We'd like a "double-counting" argument, where we count the same number in two different ways. Let's follow the breadcrumbs from the first three parts of the question.

Suppose the tutorial group has $n$ students and there will be $k$ presenters. How many ways can the presentation group be chosen?

One way is simply to say that this is $\displaystyle\binom{n}{k}$.

Another way is to separately count the presentation groups that do include you and the presentation groups that don't include you, and add them up. The presentation groups including you require $k-1$ students from the other $n -1$, which makes $\binom{n-1}{k-1}$. The presentation groups not including you require all $k$ students from the other $n-1$, which makes $\binom{n-1}{k}$. In total, the number of presentation groups is
\[ \binom{n-1}{k-1} + \binom{n-1}{k} . \]

Since we've counted the number of presentation groups in two different ways, these expressions must be equal.

*Alternatively*, you can prove algebraically that
\[  \frac{n(n-1)\cdots(n-k+1)}{k(k-1)\cdots2\cdot1} = \frac{(n-1)(n-2)\cdots(n-k+1)}{(k-1)(k-2)\cdots2\cdot1} + \frac{(n-1)(n-2)\cdots(n-k)}{k(k-1)\cdots2\cdot1} \]
(start by making $k!$ the common denominator on the right), but I feel that's against the spirit of the question.
