**B1** Starting from just the three probability axioms, prove the following statements:

::: {.subq}
**(a)** $\mathbb P(\varnothing) = 0$.
:::
::: {.subq}
**(b)** $\mathbb P(A^\comp) = 1 - \mathbb P(A)$.

**B2.** Suppose we pick a number at random from the set $\{1, 2, \dots, 2021\}$.

::: {.subq}
**(a)** What is the probability that the number is divisible by 5?
:::

::: {.subq}
**(b)** What is the probability the number is divisible by 5 or by 7?

**B3.** In this question, you will have to use the standard two-event form of the addition rule for unions
\[ \mathbb P(A \cup B) = \mathbb P(A) + \mathbb P(B) - \mathbb P(A \cap B) . \]

::: {.subq}
**(a)** Using the two-event addition rule, show that
\[ \mathbb P(C \cup D \cup E) = \mathbb P(C) + \mathbb P(D \cup E) - \mathbb P\big(C \cap (D \cup E)\big).  \]
::: 

::: {.subq}
**(b)** Using the two-event addition rule and the distributive law, or otherwise, prove the three-event form of the addition rule for unions:
\[
  \mathbb P(C \cup D \cup E) = \mathbb P(C) + \mathbb P(D) + \mathbb P(E) 
  - \mathbb P(C \cap D) - \mathbb P(C \cap E) - \mathbb P(D \cap E) + \mathbb P(C \cap D \cap E) .

**B5.** Suppose your tutorial group contains 12 students -- you and 11 others. The tutor wishes to choose 4 members of the group to present their work.

::: {.subq}
**(a)** How many ways can the tutor choose the presentation group?
:::

::: {.subq}
**(b)** How many ways can the tutor choose the presentation group if you are one of the presenters?
:::

::: {.subq}
**(c)** How many ways can the tutor choose the presentation group if you are *not* one of the presenters?

**(d)** Pascal's formula says that
\[ \binom{n}{k} = \binom{n-1}{k-1} + \binom{n-1}{k} . \]
Prove Pascal's formula.
