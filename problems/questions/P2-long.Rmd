**B2.** Suppose we pick a number at random from the set $\{1, 2, \dots, 2021\}$.

::: {.subq}
**(a)** What is the probability that the number is divisible by 5?
:::

::: {.subq}
**(b)** What is the probability the number is divisible by 5 or by 7?

**B3.** Starting with the standard two-event form of the addition rule for unions
\[ \mathbb P(A \cup B) = \mathbb P(A) + \mathbb P(B) - \mathbb P(A \cap B) , \]
prove the following three-event form:
\[
  \mathbb P(C \cup D \cup E) = \mathbb P(C) + \mathbb P(D) + \mathbb P(E) 
  - \mathbb P(C \cap D) - \mathbb P(C \cap E) - \mathbb P(D \cap E) + \mathbb P(C \cap D \cap E) .
