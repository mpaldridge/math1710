**B1.** Starting from just the three probability axioms, prove the following statements:

:::: {.subq}
**(a)** $\mathbb P(\varnothing) = 0$.

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.* Let $A$ be any event (such as $A = \varnothing$ or $A = \Omega$, for example). Then $A \cup \varnothing = A$, and the union is disjoint -- since $\varnothing$ contains no sample points, it certainly can't contain any sample points that are also in $A$. Then applying Axiom 3, we get $\mathbb P(A) + \mathbb P(\varnothing) = \mathbb P(A)$. Subtracting $\mathbb P(A)$ from both sides gives the result.

*Alternatively*, if you prove part (b) first, you can apply that with $A = \varnothing$. Since $\varnothing^\comp = \Omega$ and Axiom 2 tells us that $\mathbb P(\Omega) = 1$, the result follows.

**Group feedback:** With this, and most "prove from the axioms" questions, the key is to find a relevant disjoint union, which then allows us to use Axiom 3. So if we can find $C = A \cup B$ as a disjoint union (hopefully containing some events relevant to the question at hand), Axiom 3 allows us to write $\mathbb P(C) = \mathbb P(A) + \mathbb P(B)$.

**(b)** $\mathbb P(A^\comp) = 1 - \mathbb P(A)$.

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.* A very useful and relevant disjoint union is $A \cup A^\comp = \Omega$. Applying Axiom 3 gives us $\mathbb P(A) + \mathbb P(A^\comp) = \mathbb P(\Omega)$. But Axiom 2 tells us that $\mathbb P(\Omega) = 1$, so  $\mathbb P(A) + \mathbb P(A^\comp) = 1$. Rearranging gives the result.

**B2.** In this question, you will have to use the standard two-event form of the addition rule for unions
\[ \mathbb P(A \cup B) = \mathbb P(A) + \mathbb P(B) - \mathbb P(A \cap B) . \]


:::: {.subq}
**(a)** Using the two-event addition rule, show that
\[ \mathbb P(C \cup D \cup E) = \mathbb P(C) + \mathbb P(D \cup E) - \mathbb P\big(C \cap (D \cup E)\big).  \]

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.* As with the Cauchy--Schwarz question from Problem Sheet 1, the key is to make a good choice for what $A$ and $B$ should be. This time, $A = C$ and $B = D \cup E$ will work well, since $C \cup (D \cup E) = C \cup D \cup E$. (You can call this "associativity", if you like.) Making that substitution immediately gives us
\[ \mathbb P(C \cup D \cup E) = \mathbb P(C) + \mathbb P(D \cup E) - \mathbb P\big(C \cap (D \cup E)\big) ,  \]
as required.

**(b)** Using your result from part (a), the two-event addition rule, the distributive law, and the two-event addition rule again, prove the three-event form of the addition rule for unions:
\[
  \mathbb P(C \cup D \cup E) = \mathbb P(C) + \mathbb P(D) + \mathbb P(E) 
  - \mathbb P(C \cap D) - \mathbb P(C \cap E) - \mathbb P(D \cap E) + \mathbb P(C \cap D \cap E) .
\]

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.*
Let's take the three terms on the right of the equation from part (a) separately.

The first term is $\mathbb P(C)$, which is fine as it is.

The second term is $\mathbb P(D \cup E)$. This is the probability of the union of two events, so we can use addition rule for the union of two events to get
\[ \mathbb P(D \cup E) = \mathbb P(D) + \mathbb P(E) - \mathbb P(D \cap E) . \]

The third term is $\mathbb P\big(C \cap (D \cup E)\big)$. If we use the distributive law, as suggested in the question, we get $C \cap (D \cup E) = (C \cap D) \cup (C\cap E)$, so we want to find $\mathbb P\big((C \cap D) \cup (C\cap E)\big)$. But this is another union of two events again, this time with $A = C \cap D$ and $B = C \cap E$. So the two-event addition rule gives
\[ \mathbb P\big((C \cap D) \cup (C\cap E)\big) = \mathbb P(C \cap D) + \mathbb P(C \cap E) - \mathbb P(C \cap D \cap E) , \]
since $(C \cap D) \cap (C \cap E) = C \cap D \cap E$.

Finally, we put this all together, and get
\begin{align*}
  \mathbb P(C &\cup D \cup E) \\
  &= \mathbb P(C) + \big(\mathbb P(D) + \mathbb P(E) - \mathbb P(D \cap E)\big) - \big(\mathbb P(C \cap D) + \mathbb P(C \cap E) - \mathbb P(C \cap D \cap E)\big) \\
  &= \mathbb P(C) + \mathbb P(D) + \mathbb P(E) - \mathbb P(C \cap D) - \mathbb P(C \cap E) - \mathbb P(D \cap E) + \mathbb P(C \cap D \cap E) , 
\end{align*}
which is what we wanted.

**B3.** Suppose we pick a number at random from the set $\{1, 2, \dots, 2022\}$.

:::: {.subq}
**(a)** What is the probability that the number is divisible by 5?

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.* The sample space is $\Omega = \{1, 2, \dots, 2022\}$. Clearly $|\Omega| = 2022$. Further, the event in question is $A = \{5, 10, \dots, 2020\}$ of numbers up to 2022 that are divisible by 5. Thus $|A|$ is the largest integer no bigger than $\frac{2022}{5} = 404.4$, which is 404, as this is how many times 5 "goes into" 2022.  Hence
\[ \mathbb P(A) = \frac{|A|}{|\Omega|} = \frac{404}{2022} = 0.1998 , \]
just a tiny bit smaller than $\frac{1}{5}$.

**Group feedback:** With these "classical probability" questions, the steps should always be:

1. State clearly what the sample space $\Omega$ is.
2. Count how many outcomes $|\Omega|$ are in the sample space.
3. State clearly what the event $A$ is.
4. Count how many outcomes $|A|$ are in the event.
5. The desired probability is then $\mathbb P(A) = |A|/|\Omega|$.

:::: {.subq}
**(b)** What is the probability the number is divisible by 5 or by 7?

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.* With the same $\Omega$ and $A$, now let $B$ be the numbers up to 2022 divisible by $7$; so we're looking for $\mathbb P(A \cup B)$. By the addition rule for unions, this is
\[ \mathbb P(A \cup B) = \mathbb P(A) + \mathbb P(B) - \mathbb P(A \cap B) . \]
We already know $\mathbb P(A) = \frac{404}{2022}$, so need to find out $\mathbb P(B)$ and $\mathbb P(A \cap B)$.

As before, $|B|$ is the largest integer no bigger that $\frac{2022}{7} = 288.9$, which is $288$. So
So $\mathbb P(B) = \frac{288}{2022}$.
Now, $A \cap B$ is the numbers divisible by both 5 and 7, which is precisely the numbers divisible by $5 \times 7 = 35$. Then $|A \cap B|$ is $\frac{2022}{35} = 57.8$ rounded down, so $\mathbb P(A \cap B) = \frac{57}{2022}$.

So finally, we have
\[ \mathbb P(A \cup B) = \frac{404}{2022} + \frac{288}{2022} - \frac{57}{2022} = \frac{635}{2022} = 0.314. \]

**B4.** Eight friends are about to sit down at random at a round table. Find the probability that

:::: {.subq}
**(a)** Ashley and Brook sit next to each other, with Chris directly opposite Brook;

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.*
Let $\Omega$ be the sample space of ways the friends can sit around the table. This is an ordering problem, so $|\Omega| = 8!$.

Let $A$ be the event in the question. What is $|A|$? Well,

* Ashley can sit anywhere, so has 8 choices of seat.
* Brook can sit either directly to Ashley's left or directly to Ashley's right, so has 2 choices of seat.
* Chris must sit directly opposite Brook, so only has 1 choice of seat.
* The remaining five friends can fill up the remaining seats however they like, so have 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1 choices respectively.

Hence $|A| = 8 \times 2 \times 1 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1$. Thus we get
\[ \mathbb P(A) = \frac{|A|}{|\Omega|} = \frac{8 \times 2 \times 1 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1}{8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = \frac{2 \times 1}{7 \times 6} = \frac{1}{21} . \]

**Group feedback:** As we have discussed recently, often "classical probability" problems can be solved by the step-by-step "chain rule" method. Can you use a chain rule argument to find the same answer as
\[ \mathbb P(A) = 1 \times \frac27 \times \frac16 \times 1 \times 1 \times 1 \times 1 \times 1 = \frac{1}{21} ? \]
:::
::::

:::: {.subq}
**(b)** neither Ashley, Brook nor Chris sit next to each other.

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.*
The sample space $\Omega$ is as before. Let's count the outcomes in $B$, the event in the question.

* Ashley can sit anywhere, so has 8 choices of seat.
* Chris's number of choices will depend on where Brook sits, so we'll have to count Brook's and Chris's choices together:
   * Brook cannot sit next to Ashley.
   * If Brook sits next-but-one to Ashley -- of which there are 2 choices -- then Chris has 3 choices: Chris cannot sit on the seat directly between Ashley and Brook, nor directly next to Ashley on the other side, nor directly next to Brook on the other side, leaving $6-3=3$ choices.
   * If Brook sits neither next nor next-but-one to Ashley -- of which there are 3 choices -- then Chris has 2 choices: he cannot sit to the right or left of Ashley, nor to the right or left of Brook, leaving $6-4=2$ choices.
* The remaining friends have 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1 choices again.
   
Hence, $|B| = 8 \times (2\times 3 + 3 \times 2) \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1$. So
\[ \mathbb P(B) = \frac{|B|}{|\Omega|} = \frac{8 \times (2\times 3 + 3 \times 2) \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1}{8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = \frac{2\times 3 + 3 \times 2}{7 \times 6} = \frac{12}{42} = \frac{2}{7} .  \]

*Alternatively*, in a previous tutorial, a MATH1710 student suggested to me the following rather elegant solution. Suppose the five other friends are already sat at a round table with five chairs. Ashley, then Brook, then Chris will each bring along their own chair, and push into one of the gaps between the friends.

Ashley has 5 gaps to choose from, then Brook will have 6 gaps (Ashley joining the table will have increased the number of gaps by 1), then Chris will have 7, so the total number of ways they can push in is $|\Omega| = 5 \times 6 \times 7$.

To not sit next to each other, Ashley can push in any of the 5 gaps, Brook only has $6 - 2 = 4$ choices (not in the gap directly to the left or right of Ashley), and Chris only has $7 - 4 = 3$ choices (not in the gaps directly to the left or right of Ashley nor the gaps directly to the left or right of Brook -- these four gaps are distinct assuming Brook was not next to Ashley). Hence $|B| = 5 \times 4 \times 3$, and we have
\[ \mathbb P(B) = \frac{5 \times 4 \times 3}{5 \times 6 \times 7} = \frac{4 \times 3}{6 \times 7} = \frac{12}{42} = \frac{2}{7}.  \]

**B5.** A "random digit" is a number chosen at random from $\{0, 1, \dots, 9\}$, each with equal probability. A statistician chooses $n$ random digits (with replacement).

:::: {.subq}
**(a)** For $k = 0, 1, \dots, 9$, let $A_k$ be the event that all the digits are $k$ or smaller. What is the probability of $A_k$, as a function of $k$ and $n$?

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.*
The sample space is $\Omega = \{0,1,\dots,9\}^n$, the set of length-$n$ sequences of digits between $0$ and $9$. The number of these is $|\Omega| = 10^n$, as there are 10 choices for each of the $n$ digits.

The event $A_k$ is $\{0,1,\dots,k\}^n$, the set of length-$n$ sequences of digits that are between $0$ and $k$. The number of these is $|A_k| = (k+1)^n$. (Note that it's $k+1$ because we're allowing 0 as well.)

Hence, the probability is
\[ \mathbb P(A_k) = \frac{|A_k|}{|\Omega|} = \frac{(k+1)^n}{10^n} . \]

:::: {.subq}
**(b)** Let $B_k$ be the event that the largest digit chosen is equal to $k$. By finding a relationship between $B_k$, $A_{k-1}$ and $A_k$, or otherwise, show that
\[ \mathbb P(B_k) = \frac{(k+1)^n - k^n}{10^n} . \]

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.*
Consider the event $A_k$ that all the digits are at most $k$. Within $A_k$, *either* one or more of the digits is $k$, in which case that is the largest digit we are in $B_k$; *or* none of the digits are $k$, in which case they are all at most $k-1$, and we are in $A_{k-1}$, *but not both*. Hence we have a disjoint union
\[ A_k = B_k \cup A_{k-1} . \]
Applying Axiom 3 gives
\[ \mathbb P(A_k) = \mathbb P(B_k) + \mathbb P(A_{k-1}) . \]
Rearranging this gives
\[ \mathbb P(B_k) = \mathbb P(A_k) - \mathbb P(A_{k-1}) . \]
Substituting in the answer from part (a) gives
\[\mathbb P(B_k) = \frac{(k+1)^n}{10^n} - \frac{(k-1+1)^n}{10^n} = \frac{(k+1)^n - k^n}{10^n} . \]

Prove Pascal's formula.

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.*
We'd like a "double-counting" argument, where we count the same number in two different ways. Let's follow the breadcrumbs from the first three parts of the question.

Suppose the tutorial group has $n$ students and there will be $k$ presenters. How many ways can the presentation group be chosen?

One way is simply to say that this is $\displaystyle\binom{n}{k}$.

Another way is to separately count the presentation groups that do include you and the presentation groups that don't include you, and add them together. The presentation groups including you require another $k-1$ presenters from the other $n -1$ students, which makes $\binom{n-1}{k-1}$. The presentation groups not including you require all $k$ presenters from the other $n-1$, which makes $\binom{n-1}{k}$. In total, the number of presentation groups is
\[ \binom{n-1}{k-1} + \binom{n-1}{k} . \]

Since we've counted the number of presentation groups in two different ways, these expressions must be equal.

*Alternatively*, you can prove algebraically that
\[  \frac{n(n-1)\cdots(n-k+1)}{k(k-1)\cdots2\cdot1} = \frac{(n-1)(n-2)\cdots(n-k+1)}{(k-1)(k-2)\cdots2\cdot1} + \frac{(n-1)(n-2)\cdots(n-k)}{k(k-1)\cdots2\cdot1} \]
(start by making $k!$ the common denominator on the right), but I feel that's not in the spirit of the question.
