**C1.** A computer spam filter is 98% effective at sending spam emails to my junk folder, but will also incorrectly send 1% of legitimate emails to my junk folder. Suppose that 1 in 10 emails are spam. What proportion of emails in my junk folder are actually legitimate emails?

*Hints.* Some general advice:

* Give the events in the question names. ("If we are to kill the demon then first we have to say its name.")
* Note if any of the events make up a partition.
* Write down what probabilities (or conditional probabilities) you are told in the question.
* What probability (or conditional probability) do you want to find out?
* Are any of the results we have learned in the course about conditional probability useful here?

**C2.** A random variable $X$ is said to follow the *discrete uniform distribution* on $\{1, 2, \dots, n\}$ if each value $x$ in that set $\{1,2,\dots,n\}$ is equally likely.

:::: {.subq}
**(a)** Show that the expectation of $X$ is $\mathbb EX = \displaystyle\frac{n+1}{2}$.

:::: {.subq}
**(b)** Find the variance of $X$.

*Hint.* I recommend using the computational formula. Can you find $\mathbb EX^2$.

**(c)** Let $Y$ be a discrete uniform distribution on $\{a, a+1, a+2, \dots, b-1, b\}$, for integers $a$ and $b$ with $a<b$. Using parts (a) and (b), but without calculating any sums directly, find the expectation and variance of $Y$.

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Hint.* Is there a function that maps a "standard" discrete uniform distribution, with an appriately chosen $n$, into this one?

You may use without proof the standard results
\[ \sum_{x=1}^n x = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \qquad  \sum_{x=1}^n x^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} . \]
