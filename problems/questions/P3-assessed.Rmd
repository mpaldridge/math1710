**C1.** A computer spam filter is 98% effective at sending spam emails to my junk folder, but will also incorrectly send 1% of legitimate emails to my junk folder. Suppose that 1 in 10 emails are spam. What proportion of emails in my junk folder are actually legitimate emails? Explain your solution fully.

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.* Let's start by giving names to the events in the question:

* Let $S$ be the event that an email is spam. 
* Let $L = S^{\mathsf{c}}$ be the event that an email is legitimate. Note that $S$ and $L$ make up a partition, as each email is either spam or legitimate.
* Let $J$ be the event that an email is sent to my junk mail folder.

Now let's write down what information we are given in the question:

* $\mathbb P(J \mid S) = 0.98$, because the filter is 98% effective at sending spam emails to my junk folder.
* $\mathbb P(J \mid L) = 0.01$, because the filter incorrectly sends 1% of legitimate emails to my junk folder.
* $\mathbb P(S) = 0.1$, because 1 in 10 emails are spam. Therefore $\mathbb P(L) = \mathbb P(S^{\mathsf{c}}) = 1 - 0.1 = 0.9$.
* The question wants us to find out $\mathbb P(L \mid J)$, the proportion of emails in my junk folder that are legitimate.

Since we want $\mathbb P(L \mid J)$ but already know $\mathbb P(J \mid L)$, this suggests we should use Bayes' theorem. This gives
\[ \mathbb P(L \mid J) = \frac{\mathbb P(L) \, \mathbb P(J \mid L)}{\mathbb P(J)} = \frac{0.9 \times 0.01}{\mathbb P(J)} \tag{$*$} \]

What about the denominator $\mathbb P(J)$? Well, we know $\mathbb P(J \mid S)$ and $\mathbb P(J \mid L)$, so the law of total probability will be useful here. Since $S$ and $L$ make up a partition, we have
\[ \mathbb P(J) = \mathbb P(L) \, \mathbb P(J \mid L) + \mathbb P(S) \, \mathbb P(J \mid S) = 0.9 \times 0.01 + 0.1 \times 0.98 = 0.107 \]

Substituting this back into $(*)$, gives us
\[ \mathbb P(L \mid J) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.01}{0.107} = 0.084 , \]
So roughly 8% of emails in my junk folder are legitimate emails.

**Marks.** Up to 4 marks for mathematical accuracy. You can probably award all 4 marks if the answer at the end is correct, 3 for the right idea but a minor error, 1 or 2 marks for some progress.

Up to 3 marks for quality of writing. When awarding marks here, bear in mind:

* Does the answer clearly explain its notation?
* Does the answer clearly set out in mathematics the information given in the question?
* If the answer uses that "spam" and "legitimate" are a partition, is this explicitly stated?
* Are results used clearly cited ("By Bayes' theorem...", "Using the law of total probability...", etc)?
* Are all steps in the argument clearly explained?

**C2.** Let $X$ be a random variable.

**(a)** Let $Y = aX$ be another random variable. What is $\mathbb EY$, in terms of $\mu = \mathbb EX$?

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.* $\mathbb EY = \mathbb E(aX) = a \mathbb EX = a\mu$

**Marks.** 1 mark for correct answer; no justification or explanation required.

**(b)** Using part (a), show that $\Var(aX) = a^2 \Var(X)$.

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.*
Let $Y = aX$. Using the definitional formula, we have
\begin{multline}
\Var(Y) = \mathbb E(Y - \mu_Y)^2 = \mathbb E(aX - a\mu)^2 = \mathbb E\big(a(X-\mu)\big)^2 \\
= \mathbb E \big(a^2(X-\mu)^2\big) = a^2 \mathbb E(X - \mu)^2 = a^2 \Var(X) ,
\end{multline}
where the penultimate equality used the linearity of expectation to take the constant $a^2$ outside the expectation.

*Alternatively:* Using the computational formula, we have
\begin{multline}
\Var(aX) = \mathbb E(aX)^2 - (a\mu)^2 = \mathbb E(a^2X^2) - a^2 \mu^2 \\
= a^2 \mathbb EX^2 - a^2\mu^2 = a^2 (\mathbb EX^2 - \mu^2) = a^2 \Var(X) .
\end{multline}

**(c)** Prove that $\Var(X+b) = \Var(X)$.

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.*
First recall that $\mathbb E(X + b) = \mathbb EX + b = \mu + b$.

Using the definitional formula, we have
\[ \Var(X + b) = \mathbb E\big((X + b) - (\mu + b)\big)^2 = \mathbb E(X - \mu)^2 = \Var(X) . \]

(Using the computational formula is possible, but more hassle.)
