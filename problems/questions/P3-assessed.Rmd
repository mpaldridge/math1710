**C1.** A computer spam filter is 98% effective at sending spam emails to my junk folder, but will also incorrectly send 1% of legitimate emails to my junk folder. Suppose that 1 in 10 emails are spam. What proportion of emails in my junk folder are actually legitimate emails? Explain your solution fully.

*Hints.* Some general advice:

* Give the events in the question names. ("If we are to kill the demon then first we have to say its name.")
* Note if any of the events make up a partition.
* Write down what probabilities (or conditional probabilities) you are told in the question.
* What probability (or conditional probability) do you want to find out?
* Are any of the results we have learned in the course about conditional probability useful here?

**C2.** Let $X$ be a random variable.

**(a)** Let $Y = aX$ be another random variable. What is $\mathbb EY$, in terms of $\mu = \mathbb EX$?

**(b)** Using part (a), show that $\Var(aX) = a^2 \Var(X)$.

*Solution.*
First, we recall that $\mathbb E(aX) = a\mathbb EX = a\mu$.

Using the definitional formula, we have
\begin{multline}
\Var(aX) = \mathbb E(aX - a\mu)^2 = \mathbb E\big(a(X-\mu)\big)^2 \\
= \mathbb E \big(a^2(X-\mu)^2\big) = a^2 \mathbb E(X - \mu)^2 = a^2 \Var(X) ,
\end{multline}
where the penultimate equality used the linearity of expectation.

*Alternatively:* Using the computational formula, we have

\begin{multline}
\Var(aX) = \mathbb E(aX)^2 - (a\mu)^2 = \mathbb E(a^2X^2) - a^2 \mu^2 \\
= a^2 \mathbb EX^2 - a^2\mu^2 = a^2 (\mathbb EX^2 - \mu^2) = a^2 \Var(X) .
\end{multline}

**(c)** Prove that $\Var(X+b) = \Var(X)$.

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.*
First recall that $\mathbb E(X + b) = \mathbb EX + b = \mu + b$.

Using the definitional formula, we have
\[ \Var(X + b) = \mathbb E\big((X + b) - (\mu + b)\big)^2 = \mathbb E(X - \mu)^2 = \Var(X) . \]

(Using the computational formula is possible, but more hassle.)
