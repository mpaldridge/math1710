**B2.** Chloe cycles to work with probability $0.6$ and takes the bus with probability $0.4$. She has noticed that she is late 20% of the time when she takes the bus. Her boss notices that, on average, Chloe is late one time per week (that is, once every five days).

**(a)** What is the probability that Chloe will be late if she cycles to work?

::: {.subq}
**(b)** Chloe is late today, and her boss suspects this is because she took the bus. What is the probability that this guess is correct?

**B3.** Let $\Omega$ be a sample space, let $\mathbb P$ be a probability measure on $\Omega$, and fix an event $B \subset \Omega$ with $\mathbb P(B) > 0$. Show that the conditional probability $\mathbb P( {\cdot} \mid B)$ is also a probability measure on $\Omega$. That is, show that the conditional probability also satisfies the probability axioms:

1. $\mathbb P(A \mid B) \geq 0$ for all events $A \subset \Omega$;
1. $\mathbb P(\Omega \mid B) = 1$;
1. For disjoint events $A_1, A_2, \dots$, we have
\[ \mathbb P(A_1 \cup A_2 \cup \cdots \mid B) = \mathbb P(A_1 \mid B) + \mathbb P(A_2 \mid B) + \cdots . \]

**B4.** Soldiers are asked about their use of illegal drugs, but to protect their privacy and ensure honest answers, a "randomised survey" is used. Each soldier is handed a deck of three cards, picks one of the three cards at random, and responds according to what the card says. The three cards say:

1. "Say 'Yes.'"
2. "Say 'No.'"
3. "Truthfully answer the question 'Have you taken any illegal drugs in the past 12 months?'"

**(a)** 40% of soldiers respond "Yes". What is the likely proportion of soldiers who have taken illegal drugs in the past 12 months.

**(b)** If a soldier responds "Yes", what is the probability that the soldier has taken illegal drugs in the past 12 months.

**B6.** A gambling game works as follows. You keep tossing a fair coin until you first get a Head. If your first Head comes on the $n$th coin toss, then you win $2^n$ pounds.

::: {.subq}
**(a)** What is the probability that the first Head is seen on the $n$th toss of the coin?

**(b)** Show that the expected winnings from playing this game are infinite.

**(c)** The "St Petersburg paradox" refers to the fact that, despite the fact that the expected winnings from this game are infinite, hardly anybody would be prepared to play this game for, say, £100, and certainly not for £1000. Discuss a few possible "resolutions" to this paradox which could explain why people are unwilling to play this game despite seemingly having infinite expected winnings.
