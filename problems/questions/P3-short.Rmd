**A2.** Three events $A, B, C$ are said to be *pairwise independent* if each pair of events are independent -- that is, if $A$ and $B$ are independent, $B$ and $C$ are independent, and $A$ and $C$ are independent. The three events are said to *mutually independent* if they are pairwise independent and also $\mathbb P(A \cap B \cap C) = \mathbb P(A)\,\mathbb P(B)\,\mathbb P(C)$.

Consider rolling two dice independently. Let $A$ be the event that the first roll is even, let $B$ be the event that the second roll is even, and let $C$ be the event that the total score is even.

|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| $p(x)$ | $0.1$ | $0.3$ | $0.3$ | $0.2$ | $0.1$ |
