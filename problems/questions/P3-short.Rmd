**A1.** Consider dealing two cards (without replacement) from a pack of cards. Which of the following pairs of events are independent?

::::{ .subq}
**(a)** "The first card is a Heart" and "The first card is Red".

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.* 
We have
\begin{align*}
\mathbb P(\text{first Heart}) &= \frac{13}{52} = \frac14 \\
\mathbb P(\text{first Red}) &= \frac{26}{52} = \frac12 \\
\mathbb P(\text{first Heart and first Red}) &= \mathbb P(\text{first Heart}) = \frac14 .
\end{align*}
So $\mathbb P(\text{first Heart and first Red}) \neq \mathbb P(\text{first Heart})\,\mathbb P(\text{first Red})$, and the events are not independent.

We have

**A2.** Consider rolling two dice. Let $A$ be the event that the first roll is even, let $B$ be the event that the second roll is even, and let $C$ be the event that the total score is even. You may assume the dice rolls are independent; so, in particular, events $A$ and $B$ are independent.

:::: {.subq}
**(a)** Are $A$ and $C$ independent?

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.* First note that the probability that a dice is even is $\frac{3}{6} = \frac12$, and the probability the total of two dice is also $\frac{18}{36} = \frac12$.

* $A$ and $B$ are independent by assumption.
* Since the sum of two even numbers is even, while even plus odd equals odd, we have that $A$ and $C$ occur if and only if both dice are even, which has probability $\frac12 \times \frac12 = \frac14$. Hence $\mathbb P(A \cap C) = \mathbb P(A) \times \mathbb P(C) = \frac14$, so $A$ and $C$ are independent.
* For the same reason, $V$ and $C$ occur if and only if both dice are even, which has probability $\frac12 \times \frac12 = \frac14$. Hence $\mathbb P(B \cap C) = \mathbb P(B) \times \mathbb P(C) = \frac14$, so $B$ and $C$ are independent.

Hence $A$, $B$ and $C$ are pairwise independent.

**(b)** Is it true that $\mathbb P(A \cap B \cap C) = \mathbb P(A) \, \mathbb P(B) \, \mathbb P(C)$?

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.*
For the same reasons as above, $A \cap B \cap C$ occurs if and only if both dice rolls are even, which happens with probability $\frac12\times\frac12 = \frac14$. Hence, $\mathbb P(A \cap B \cap C) = \frac14$, but $\mathbb P(A)\,\mathbb P(B)\,\mathbb P(C) = \frac12\times\frac12\times\frac12 = \frac18$. So $A$, $B$ and $C$ are not mutually independent.

**A3.** Consider the random variable $X$ with the following PMF:

| $x$ | $-1$ | $0$ | $0.5$ | $1$ | $2$ |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| $p(x)$ | $0.1$ | $0.3$ | $0.3$ | $0.2$ | $0.1$ |

Find the expectation and variance of $X$.

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.*
For the expectation,
\[ \mathbb EX = -1\times0.1 + 0\times0.3 + 0.5\times0.3+1\times0.2+2\times0.1 = 0.45. \]

For the variance, we start with
\[ \mathbb EX^2 = (-1)^2\times0.1 + 0^2\times0.3 + 0.5^2\times0.3+1^2\times0.2+2^2\times0.1 = 0.775 . \]
Then, using the computational formula,
\[ \Var(X) = \mathbb EX^2 - \mu^2 = 0.775 - 0.45^2 = 0.5725. \]

*[**Note:** The answers at the bottom of the problem sheet for this were wrong.]*

**A4.** Consider the random variable $X$ with the following PMF:

| $x$ | $1$ | $2$ | $4$ | $5$ | $a$ |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| $p(x)$ | $0.1$ | $0.2$ | $0.1$ | $b$ | $0.1$ |

This random variable has $\mathbb EX = 4.3$. Find the values of $a$ and $b$.

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.*
First, a PMF must sum to 1, so
\[ 1 = 0.1 + 0.2 + 0.1 + b + c , \]
and hence
\[ b + c = 0.6 . \qquad\qquad (1) \]

Second, the expectation is
\begin{align*}
\mathbb EX &= 1\times0.1 + 2 \times 0.2 + 4 \times 0.1 + 5b + ac \\
           &= 0.9 + 5b + ac \\
           &= 4.3 .
\end{align*}
Hence
\[ 5b + ac = 3.4 . \qquad\qquad (2) \]

Third, the expectation of $X^2$ is
\begin{align*}
\mathbb EX &= 1^2\times0.1 + 2^2 \times 0.2 + 4^2 \times 0.1 + 5^2b + a^2c \\
           &= 2.5 + 25b + a^2c 
\end{align*}
and this must equal $\mathbb EX^2 = \Var(X) + \mu^2 = 4.61 + 3.4^2 = 23.1$. Hence
\[ 25b + a^2 c = 20.6 \qquad\qquad (3) . \]

Now we just have to solve the three equations. From (1) we get $b = 0.6 - c$, and substituting into (2) and (3) gives
\begin{align*}
(a-5)c &= 0.4 \qquad\qquad (4) \\
(a^2 - 25)c &= 5.6 \qquad\qquad(5)
\end{align*}
Noting that $a^2 - 25 = (a+5)(a-5)$ is a difference of two squares, we can divide (5) by (4) to get
\[ a + 5 = \frac{5.6}{0.4} = 14. \]
So $a = 9$. Substituting this into (4) gives $c = 0.1$, so $b = 0.6 - 0.1 = 0.5$.

**A5.** A temperature $T_C$ measured in degrees Celsius can be converted to a temperature $T_F$ in degrees Fahrenheit using the formula $T_F = \frac95 T_C + 32$.

The average daily maximum temperature in Leeds in July is 19.0 °C. The variance of the daily maximum temperature measured in degrees Celsius is 10.4.

:::: {.subq}
**(a)** What is the average daily maximum temperature in degrees Fahrenheit?

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.*
By linearity of expectation,
\[ \mathbb E T_F = \mathbb E\left(\tfrac95T_C + 32\right) = \tfrac95 \mathbb ET_C + 32 . \]
So the answer is $\frac95 \times 19.0 + 32 = 66.2$ °F.
:::
::::

:::: {.subq}
**(b)** What is the variance of the daily maximum temperature when measured in degrees Fahrenheit?

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.*
For the variance,
\[ \Var(T_F) = \Var\left(\tfrac95T_C + 32\right) = \left(\tfrac95\right)^2 \Var(T_C) = \tfrac{81}{25}\Var(T_C). \]
So the answer is $\frac{81}{25} \times 10.4 = 33.7$ °F^2^.
