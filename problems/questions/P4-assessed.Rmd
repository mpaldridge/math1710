*Because marking time will be reduced due to the [UCU strike](https://www.leedsucu.org.uk/information-for-students-2/) on Wednesday 30 November, Questions C1(d) and C2(c) are no longer required to be submitted. You may choose to complete for your own practice.*

::::: {.myq}
**C1.** A collector wants to collect football stickers to fill an album. There are $n$ unique stickers to collect. Each time the collector buys a sticker, it is one of the $n$ stickers chosen independently uniformly at random. Unfortunately, it is likely the collector will end up having "swaps", where he has received the same sticker more than once, so he will likely need to buy more than $n$ stickers in total to fill his album. But how many?

:::: {.subq}
**(a)** Suppose the collector has already got $j$ unique stickers (and some number of swaps). Let $X_j$ be the the number of extra stickers he buys until getting a new unique sticker. Explain why $X_j$ is geometrically distributed, and state the parameter $p = p_j$ of the geometric distribution.

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Hint.* To get a new sticker you need to "succeed" in an experiment, where "failure" is "receiving a sticker you already have a copy of" and "success" is "receiving a new sticker you haven't already got". What is the probabiltiy of success?

:::: {.subq}
**(b)** Hence, show that the expected number of stickers the collector must buy to fill his album is
\[ n \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{k} . \]

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Hint.* Recall the expectation of the geometric distribution, and use linearity of expectaiton.

:::: {.subq}
**(c)** The Euro 2020 sticker album required $n = 678$ unique stickers to complete it, and stickers cost 15p each. Using the expression from (b), calculate the expected amount of money needed to fill the album. You should do this calculation in R and include the command you used in your answer.

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Hint.* In R, `sum(1 / (1:678))` sum the reciprocals of the integers from 1 to 678.

:::: {.subq}
~~**(d)** By approximating the sum in part (b) by an integral, explain why the expected number of stickers required is approximately $n \log n$, where $\log$ denotes the natural logarithm to base $\mathrm e$.~~

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Hint.* A detailed proof is not required -- just informally explain why the sum is approximately the area under the function (ie the integral).

::::: {.myq}
**C2.** Let $X$ and $Y$ be random variables, and let $a$ and $b$ be constants.

:::: {.subq}
**(a)** Starting from the definition of covariance, show that $\Cov(aX, Y) = a\,\Cov(X,Y)$. You may find it helpful to remember that if $\mathbb EX = \mu_X$, then $\mathbb EaX = a\mu_X$.
::::

:::: {.subq}
**(b)** Show that $\Cov(X + b, Y) = \Cov(X, Y)$.

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Hint.* You may find it helpful to look back at Theorem 7.4 in the notes.
:::
::::

~~Now let $X, Y, Z$ be *independent* random variables with common variance $\sigma^2$.~~

:::: {.subq}
~~**(c)** Find the value of $\Corr(2X - 3Y + 4, 2Y - Z - 1)$. You may use any facts about covariance from the notes, including those from parts (a) and (b) of this question, provided you state them clearly.~~

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Hint.* Start by calculating the covariance. Try to sort out the $2X - 3Y + 4$ part first, using the rules above. Once that's done you can then deal with the $2Y - Z -1$ part with the same rules, because $\Cov(U, V) = \Cov(V,U)$, so anything you can do to the first term you can also do to the second.
