**B1.** Calculate the CDF $F(x) = \mathbb P(X \leq x)$ of the geometric distribution...

**(a)** ...by summing the PMF;

**(b)** ...by explaining how the "number of trials until success" definition tells us what $1 - F(x) = \mathbb P(X > x)$ must be.

**(c)** A gambler rolls a pair of dice until he gets a double-six. What is the probability that this takes between 20 and 40 double-rolls?

**B2.** Let $Y$ be a geometric distribution with parameter $p$ according to the alternative "number of failures *before* the first success" definition.

:::: {.subq}
**(a)** Write down the PMF for $Y$.

:::: {.subq}
**(b)** Calculate the expectation and variance of $Y$. You may use without proof the fact that for a standard "number of trials up to and including the first success" geometric distribution we have $\mathbb EX = 1/p$ and $\Var(X) = (1-p)/p^2$.

**B3** Let $X \sim \text{Po}(\lambda)$.

::: {.subq}
**(a)** Show that $\mathbb EX(X-1) = \lambda^2$. You may use the Taylor series for the exponential,
\[ \mathrm{e}^\lambda = \sum_{y=0}^\infty \frac{\lambda^y}{y!} . \]
:::

::: {.subq}
**(b)** Hence show that $\Var(X) = \lambda$. You may use the fact, proved in the notes, that $\mathbb EX = \lambda$.

**B4.** Each week in the UK about 15 million Lotto tickets are sold. As we saw in Section 3, the probability of each ticket winning is about 1 in 45 million. Estimate the proportion of weeks when there is **(a)** a roll-over (no jackpot winners), **(b)** a unique jackpot winner, or **(c)** when multiple winners share the jackpot. State any modelling assumptions you make and the approximation that you use.

**B5.**  Let $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n$ be IID random variable with common expectation $\mu$ and common variance $\sigma^2$, and let $\overline X = (X_1 + \cdots + X_n)n$ be the mean of these random variables. We will be considering the random variable $S^2$ given by
\[ S^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \overline X)^2 . \]

:::: {.subq}
**(a)** By writing 
\[ X_i - \overline X = (X_i - \mu) - (\overline X - \mu)  \]
or otherwise, show that
\[ S^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \mu)^2 - n(\overline X - \mu)^2 . \]
::::

:::: {.subq}
**(b)** Hence or otherwise, show that
\[ \mathbb E S^2 = (n - 1)\sigma^2 . \]
You may use facts about $\overline X$ from the notes provided you state them clearly. You might also find it useful to recall that if a random variable $Y$ has expectation $\mathbb EY = 0$, then $\mathbb EY^2 = \Var(Y)$.

**(c)** At the beginning of this course, we defined the sample variance of the values $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$ to be
\[ s^2_x = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar x)^2 . \]
Explain one reason why we might consider it appropriate to use $1/(n-1)$ as the factor at the beginning of this expression, rather than simply $1/n$.
