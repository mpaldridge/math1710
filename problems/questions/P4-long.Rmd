**B1.** Calculate the CDF $F(x) = \mathbb P(X \leq x)$ of the geometric distribution...

**(a)** ...by summing the PMF;

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.*
We have,using the standard formula for the sum of a finite geometric progression, 
\begin{align*}
F(x) &= \sum_{y = 1}^x p(y) \\
&= \sum_{y = 1}^x (1-p)^{y-1} p \\
&= \frac{p\big(1 - (1-p)^x\big)}{1 - (1-p)} \\
&= \frac{p\big(1 - (1-p)^x\big)}{p} \\
&= 1 - (1 - p)^x .

**(b)** ...by explaining how the "number of trials until success" definition tells us what $1 - F(x) = \mathbb P(X > x)$ must be.

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.*
Note that $1 - F(x) = \mathbb P(X > x)$ is precisely the probability that the first $x$ trials are failures, and hence that the first success comes strictly after the $x$th trial. The probability that the first $x$ trials are failures is $(1-p)^x$. So $F(x) = 1 - (1-p)^x$.

**(c)** A gambler rolls a pair of dice until he gets a double-six. What is the probability that this takes between 20 and 40 double-rolls?

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.*
Let $X \sim \text{Geom}(\frac{1}{36})$. Then
\begin{align*}
\mathbb P(20 \leq X \leq 40) &= \mathbb P(X \leq 40) - \mathbb P(X \leq 19) \\
  &= F(40) - F(19) \\
  &= \bigg(1 - \big(1 - \tfrac{1}{36})^{40}\bigg) - \bigg(1 - \big(1 - \tfrac{1}{36})^{19}\bigg) \\
  &= 0.676 - 0.414 \\
  &= 0.261.

**B2.** Let $Y$ be a geometric distribution with parameter $p$ according to the alternative "number of failures *before* the first success" definition.

:::: {.subq}
**(a)** Write down the PMF for $Y$.

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.* Having $Y = y$ requires $y$ consecutive failures immediately followed by a success. So $p_Y(y) = (1-p)^y p$.

:::: {.subq}
**(b)** Calculate the expectation and variance of $Y$. You may use without proof the fact that for a standard "number of trials up to and including the first success" geometric distribution we have $\mathbb EX = 1/p$ and $\Var(X) = (1-p)/p^2$.

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.* If $X \sim \text{Geom}(p)$ under the standard definition, then (as we saw in the notes) $Y$ has the same distribution as $X -1$. Therefore,
\[ \mathbb EY = \mathbb E(X-1) = \mathbb EX - 1 = \frac{1}{p} - 1 = \frac{1-p}{p} \]
and
\[ \Var(Y) = \Var(X -1) = \Var(X) = \frac{1-p}{p^2} .  \]

**B3** Let $X \sim \text{Po}(\lambda)$.

:::: {.subq}
**(a)** Show that $\mathbb EX(X-1) = \lambda^2$. You may use the Taylor series for the exponential,
\[ \mathrm{e}^\lambda = \sum_{y=0}^\infty \frac{\lambda^y}{y!} . \]

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.*
We follow exactly the method used to calculate $\mathbb EX$ in the notes. We have
\begin{align*}
\mathbb EX(X-1) &= \sum_{x=0}^\infty x(x-1)\, \mathrm e^{-\lambda} \frac{\lambda^x}{x!} \\
  &= \lambda^2 \mathrm e^{-\lambda} \sum_{x=2}^\infty \frac{\lambda^{x-2}}{(x - 2)!} \\
  &= \lambda^2 \mathrm e^{-\lambda}\sum_{y=0}^\infty  \frac{\lambda^y}{y!} \\
  &= \lambda^2 \mathrm e^{-\lambda} \, \mathrm e^{\lambda} \\
  &= \lambda^2  .
\end{align*}
In the second line, we took a $\lambda^2$ and a $\mathrm e^{-\lambda}$ outside the brackets; cancelled the $x$ and $x-1$ out of the $x!$; and removed the $x = 0$ and $x = 1$ terms from the sum, since they were 0 anyway. In the third line, we re-indexed the sum by setting $y = x - 2$. In the fourth line, we used the Taylor series for the exponential
:::

:::: {.subq}
**(b)** Hence show that $\Var(X) = \lambda$. You may use the fact, proved in the notes, that $\mathbb EX = \lambda$.

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.* 
We know from part (a) that 
\[ \mathbb EX(X-1) = \mathbb E(X^2 - X) = \mathbb EX^2 - \mathbb EX = \mathbb EX^2 - \lambda = \lambda^2 ,\]
which gives $\mathbb EX^2 = \lambda^2 + \lambda$. We can then use the computational formula for the variance to get
\[ \Var(X) = \mathbb EX^2 - \lambda^2 = \lambda^2 + \lambda - \lambda^2 = \lambda .\]

**B4.** Each week in the UK about 15 million Lotto tickets are sold. As we saw in [Lecture 6](#combinations), the probability of each ticket winning is about 1 in 45 million. Estimate the proportion of weeks when there is **(a)** a roll-over (no jackpot winners), **(b)** a unique jackpot winner, or **(c)** when multiple winners share the jackpot. State any modelling assumptions you make and the approximation that you use.

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.*
We assume that each ticket is uniformly randomly chosen from all possible tickets, independent of all other tickets. Then the number of winners is $X \sim \text{Bin}(15 \text{ million}, 1/(45 \text{ million}))$.
It will be convenient to use a Poisson approximation with rate
\[ \lambda = 15 \text{ million} \times \frac{1}{45 \text{ million}} = \tfrac13 .  \]

The probability there is a roll-over is 
\[ \mathbb P(X = 0) \approx \mathrm e^{-1/3} = 0.72 . \]
The probability there is a unique jackpot winner is
\[ \mathbb P(X = 1) \approx \tfrac13 \mathrm e^{-1/3} = 0.24 . \]
The probability there are multiple winners is
\[ \mathbb P(X \geq 2) = 1 - \mathbb P(X = 0) - \mathbb P(X = 1) = 0.04  . \]

**B5.** Let $X$ and $Y$ be Bernoulli$(\frac12)$ random variables.

:::: {.subq}
**(a)** Write down the table for the joint PMF of $X$ and $Y$ if $X$ and $Y$ are independent.

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.* 
For all these questions, we need to fill in a table for the joint PMF, where the columns sum to $p_X(0) = p_X(1) = \frac12$ and the rows sum to $p_Y(0) = p_Y(1) = \frac12$.

| $p_{X,Y}(x,y)$ | $x = 0$ | $x = 1$ | $p_Y(y)$ |
|:--------:|:---------:|:---------:|:----------:|
| $y = 0$  |           |           | $\frac12$  |
| $y = 1$  |           |           | $\frac12$  |
| $p_Y(y)$ | $\frac12$ | $\frac12$ |            | 

If $X$ and $Y$ are independent, we have $p_{X,Y}(x,y) = p_X(x)\,p_Y(y)$; so, for example, $p_{X,Y}(0,0) = p_X(0)\,p_Y(0) = \frac12 \times \frac12 = \frac14$. In fact, all the entries in the joint PMF table are $\frac14$.

| $p_{X,Y}(x,y)$ | $x = 0$ | $x = 1$ | $p_Y(y)$ |
|:--------:|:---------:|:---------:|:----------:|
| $y = 0$  | $\frac14$ | $\frac14$ | $\frac12$  |
| $y = 1$  | $\frac14$ | $\frac14$ | $\frac12$  |
| $p_Y(y)$ | $\frac12$ | $\frac12$ |            |

**(b)** Write down a table for a joint PMF of $X$ and $Y$ that is consistent with their marginal distributions but that leads to $X$ and $Y$ having a positive correlation.

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.*
We still need the rows and columns to add up to $\frac12$, but we want low values of $X$ (that is, 0) to be more likely to occur alongside low values of $Y$ (that is, 0), and high values of $X$ (that is, 1) alongside high values of $Y$ (that is, 1). One was to do this is

| $p_{X,Y}(x,y)$ | $x = 0$ | $x = 1$ | $p_Y(y)$ |
|:--------:|:---------:|:---------:|:----------:|
| $y = 0$ | $\frac12$ | $0$ | $\frac12$  |
| $y = 1$ | $0$ | $\frac12$ | $\frac12$  |
| $p_Y(y)$ | $\frac12$ | $\frac12$ |            | 

A single table like that is a perfectly sufficient answer. But, in fact, any table of the form

| $p_{X,Y}(x,y)$ | $x = 0$ | $x = 1$ | $p_Y(y)$ |
|:--------:|:---------:|:---------:|:----------:|
| $y = 0$  | $a$ |  $\frac12 - a$  | $\frac12$  |
| $y = 1$  |  $\frac12 - a$  | $a$ | $\frac12$  |
| $p_Y(y)$ | $\frac12$ | $\frac12$ |            | 

for $\frac14 < a \leq \frac12$ will do. This has
\[ \mathbb EXY = \sum_{x,y} xy\, p_{X,Y}(x,y) = p_{X,Y}(1, 1) = a , \]
as $x = y = 1$ is the only nonzero term in the sum. This means the covariance is, by the computational formula,
\[ \Cov(X,Y) = \mathbb EXY - \mu_X \mu_Y = a - \tfrac12 \times \tfrac12 = a - \tfrac14 . \]
So the covariance is positive for $a > \frac14$, so the correlation is too.

**(c)** Write down a table for a joint PMF of $X$ and $Y$ that is consistent with their marginal distributions but that leads to $X$ and $Y$ having a negative correlation.

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.* For example

| $p_{X,Y}(x,y)$ | $x = 0$ | $x = 1$ | $p_Y(y)$ |
|:--------:|:---------:|:---------:|:----------:|
| $y = 0$ | $0$ | $\frac12$ | $\frac12$  |
| $y = 1$ | $\frac12$ | $0$ | $\frac12$  |
| $p_Y(y)$ | $\frac12$ | $\frac12$ |            | 

Alternatively, any table of the form

| $p_{X,Y}(x,y)$ | $x = 0$ | $x = 1$ | $p_Y(y)$ |
|:--------:|:---------:|:---------:|:----------:|
| $y = 0$  | $a$ |  $\frac12 - a$  | $\frac12$  |
| $y = 1$  |  $\frac12 - a$  | $a$ | $\frac12$  |
| $p_Y(y)$ | $\frac12$ | $\frac12$ |            | 

for $0 \leq a < \frac14$ will have negative covariance $a - \frac14$, so negative correlation.
