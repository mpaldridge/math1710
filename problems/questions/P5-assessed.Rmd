**C1.** Let $X$ be a continuous random variable with PDF
\[ f(x) = \tfrac29 (2 − x) \qquad \text{for $-1 \leq x \leq c$} \]
and $f(x) = 0$ otherwise.
(a) Find the cdf, F (x), and hence find the constant c. What is the probability P r(X > 1)?
(b) Calculate the expectation and variance of X. Next suppose that Y = (X2 − 1)/2. What is the range space of Y and what is its expectation?

*Hint.* To get a new sticker you need to "succeed" in an experiment, where "failure" is "receiving a sticker you already have a copy of" and "success" is "receiving a new sticker you haven't already got". What is the probabiltiy of success?
