**C1.** Let $X$ be a continuous random variable with PDF
\[ f(x) = \tfrac29 (2 - x) \qquad \text{for $-1 \leq x \leq c$} \]
and $f(x) = 0$ otherwise.

:::: {.subq}
**(a)** Explaining your work, find the value of the constant $c$.

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Hint.* Remember that the integral under a PDF must equal 1.

**(b)** 
What is $\mathbb P(X > 1)$?

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Hint.* This is standard.

**(c)** Calculate the expectation of$X$.

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Hint.* This is standard.

**(d)** Calculate the variance of $X$.

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Hint.* This is standard. I recommend using the computational formula, so start by finding $\mathbb EX^2$.

**C2.** For each of the following, **(a)** calculate the *exact* value using R; **(b)** get an approximate value using an appropriate approximation and *without* using R. ([Statistical tables](https://mpaldridge.github.io/math1710/stat-tab.pdf) are available.)

:::: {.subq}
**(i)** $\mathbb P(X \leq 3)$, where $X \sim \mathrm{Bin}(1000, 0.005)$.

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Hint.* For the approximation, note that $n$ is large and $p$ is small.

**(ii)** $\mathbb P(296 \leq Y \leq 307)$, where $Y \sim \mathrm{Bin}(1200, 0.25)$.

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Hint.* For the approximation, note that $n$ is large and $p$ is *not* small.

**(iii)** $\mathbb P(Z \geq 398)$, where $Z \sim \mathrm{Bin}(400, 0.995)$.

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Hint.* This one will require you to think for yourself! I have not told you how to do this question. You might notice it looks a bit like the Poisson `small $p$' case, but mirror-imaged. How can you use this to your advantage.
