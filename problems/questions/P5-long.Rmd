**(a)** Let $X \sim \text{Exp}(\lambda)$. Show that
\[ \mathbb P(X > x + y \mid X > y) = \mathbb P(X > x) . \]

**(c)** When you get to certain bus stop, the average amount of time you have to wait for a bus to arrive is 20 minutes. Specifically, the time until the next bus arrives is modelled as an exponential distribution with expectation $1/\lambda = 20$ minutes. Suppose you have already been waiting at the bus stop for 15 minutes. What is the expected further amount of time you still have to wait for a bus to arrive?

**B2.** The main dangerous radioactive material left over after the Chernobyl disaster is Caesium-137. The amount of time it takes a Caesium-137 particle to decay is known to follow an exponential distribution with rate $\lambda = 0.023$ years^-1^.

**(b)** The "half-life" of a radioactive substance is the amount of time it takes for half of the substance to decay. Using the information in the question, calculate the half-life of Caesium-137.

**(c)** It is estimated that roughly 24 kg of Caesium-137 was released during the Chernobyl disaster, which happened roughly 35.6 years ago. Estimate the mass of Caesium-137 that has still not decayed?

**B3.** Consider the pair of random variables $(X,Y)$ with joint PDF
\[ f_{X,Y}(x,y) = 2 \qquad \text{for $0 \leq x \leq y \leq 1$} \]
and $f_{X,Y}(x,y) = 0$ otherwise. (In particular, note that the joint PDF is only nonzero when $x \leq y$.)
